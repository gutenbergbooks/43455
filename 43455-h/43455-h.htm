<h1>BASEBALL JOE IN THE
WORLD SERIES</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>AN INSOLENT INTRUDER</small></h2>


<p>“Here he comes!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Matson!”</p>

<p>“Great game, old man.”</p>

<p>“You stood the Chicagos on their heads that
time, Joe.”</p>

<p>“That home run of yours was a dandy.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Matson?”</p>

<p>“<em>He’s all right!</em>”</p>

<p>A wild uproar greeted the appearance of Joe
Matson, the famous pitcher of the New York
Giants, as he emerged from the clubhouse at the
Polo Grounds after the great game in which he
had pitched the Giants to the head of the National
League and put them in line for the World Series
with the champions of the American League.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that the crowd had gone
crazy with excitement. All New York shared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
same madness. The race for the pennant had
been one of the closest ever known. In the last
few weeks it had narrowed down to a fight between
the Giants and the Chicagos, and the two
teams had come down the stretch, nose to nose,
fighting for every inch, each straining every nerve
to win. It had been a slap-dash, ding-dong finish,
and the Giants had won “by a hair.”</p>

<p>Joe Matson&mdash;affectionately known as “Baseball
Joe”&mdash;had pitched the deciding game, and to him
above all others had gone the honors of the victory.
Not only had he twirled a superb game,
but it had been his home run in the ninth inning
after two men were out that had brought the pennant
to New York.</p>

<p>And just at this moment his name was on more
tongues than that of any other man in the United
States. Telegraph wires had flashed the news of
his triumph to every city and village in the country,
and the cables and wireless had borne it to
every American colony in the world.</p>

<p>Joe’s hand had been shaken and his back
pounded by exulting enthusiasts until he was lame
and sore all over. It was with a feeling of relief
that he had gained the shelter of the clubhouse
with its refreshing shower and rubdown. Even
here his mates had pawed and mauled him in their
delight at the glorious victory, until he had laughingly
threatened to thrash a few of them. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
now, as, after getting into his street clothes, he
came out into the side street and viewed the crowd
that waited for him, he saw that he was in for a
new ordeal.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” he exclaimed to his friend and
fellow player, Jim Barclay, who accompanied him.
“Will they never let up on me?”</p>

<p>“It’s one of the penalties of fame, old man,”
laughed Jim. “Don’t make out that you don’t
like it, you old hypocrite.”</p>

<p>“Of course I like it,” admitted Joe with a grin.
“All the same I don’t want to have this old wing
of mine torn from its socket. I need it in my business.”</p>

<p>“You bet you do,” agreed Jim. “It’s going to
come in mighty handy for the World Series. But
we’ll be out of this in a minute.”</p>

<p>He held up his hand to signal a passing taxicab,
and the cab edged its way to the curb.</p>

<p>The crowd swept in upon the players and they
had all they could do to elbow their way through.
They succeeded finally and slammed the door shut,
while the chauffeur threw in the clutch and the
taxicab darted off, pursued by the shouts and
plaudits of the crowd.</p>

<p>Joe sank back on the cushions with a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>“The first free breath I’ve drawn since the game
ended,” he remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s been a wonderful day for you, Joe,” said
Jim, looking at his chum with ungrudging admiration.
“That game will stand out in baseball history
for years to come.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad I won for my own sake,” answered
Joe; “but I’m gladder still on account of
the team. The boys backed me up in great shape&mdash;except
in that fifth inning&mdash;and I’d have felt
fearfully sore if I hadn’t been able to deliver the
goods. But those Chicagos certainly made us fight
to win.”</p>

<p>“They’re a great team,” admitted Jim; “and
they put up a corking good game. But it was our
day to win.”</p>

<p>“Did you see McRae and Robson after the
game?” he went on, referring to the manager and
the coach of the Giant team. “Whatever dignity
they had, they lost it then. They fairly hugged
each other and did the tango in front of the clubhouse.”</p>

<p>Joe grinned as the burly figures came before his
mental vision.</p>

<p>“They’ve been under a fearful strain for the
last few weeks,” he commented; “and I guess they
had to let themselves go in some fashion or they’d
have burst.”</p>

<p>“Do you realize what that home run of yours
meant in money, to say nothing of the glory?”
jubilated Jim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“I haven’t had time to do much figuring yet,”
smiled Joe.</p>

<p>“It meant at least fifty thousand dollars for
the team,” pursued Jim. “We’ll get that much
even if we lose the World Series, and a good deal
more if we win. And if the Series goes to six or
seven games the management will scoop in a big
pot of money, too&mdash;anywhere from fifty to a hundred
thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” replied Joe, a little absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>“Good?” echoed Jim, sharply. “It’s more than
good&mdash;it’s great, it’s glorious! Wake up, man,
and stop your dreaming.”</p>

<p>Joe came to himself with a little start.</p>

<p>“You’re&mdash;you’re right, Jim,” he stammered
somewhat confusedly. “To tell the truth, I wasn’t
thinking just then of money.”</p>

<p>Jim gave him a quick glance, and a sudden look
of amused comprehension came into his eyes. Joe
caught his glance and flushed.</p>

<p>“What are you blushing about?” demanded
Jim with a grin.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t blushing,” defended Joe, stoutly.
“It’s mighty warm in this cab.”</p>

<p>Jim laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Tell that to the King of Denmark,” he chuckled.
“I’m on, old man. You told me in the clubhouse
that you were going to the Marlborough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Hotel, and I know just who it is that’s stopping
there.”</p>

<p>“My friend, Reggie Varley, is putting up there,”
countered Joe, feebly.</p>

<p>“My friend Reggie Varley,” mimicked Jim, “to
say nothing of his charming sister. Oh, I’m not
blind, old fellow. I’ve seen for a long time how
the wind was blowing. Well,” he continued, dropping
his light tone for a more earnest one, “go in
and win, Joe. I hope you have all the luck in the
world.”</p>

<p>He reached over and slapped his friend cordially
on the shoulder. Then he signaled for the
chauffeur to stop.</p>

<p>“What are you getting out here for?” asked
Joe. “We haven’t got to your street yet.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” answered Jim, preparing to jump
out. “I want to give you a chance to think up what
you’re going to say to the lady fair,” he added,
mischievously.</p>

<p>He ducked the friendly thrust that Joe made
toward him and went away laughing, while the
cab started on.</p>

<p>Joe knew perfectly well what he intended to
say when he should meet Mabel Varley. He had
wanted to say it for a long time, and had determined
that if his team won the pennant he would
wait no longer.</p>

<p>He had met her for the first time two years before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
under unusual circumstances. At that time he
was playing in the Central League, and his team
was training at Montville, North Carolina. He
had saved Mabel from being carried over a cliff by
a runaway horse, and the acquaintance thus
formed had soon deepened into friendship. With
Joe it had now become a much stronger feeling,
and he had dared to hope that this was shared by
Mabel.</p>

<p>Reggie Varley, Mabel’s brother, was a rather
affected young man, who ran chiefly to clothes
and automobiles and had an accent that he fondly
supposed was English. Joe had met him at an
earlier date than that at which he had formed
Mabel’s acquaintance and under unpleasant conditions.
Reggie had lost sight of his valise in a
railway station, and had rashly accused Joe of taking
it. He apologized later, however, and the
young men had become the best of friends, for
Reggie, despite some foolish little affectations,
was at heart a thoroughly good fellow.</p>

<p>The brother and sister had come to New York
to see the deciding games and were quartered at
the Marlborough Hotel. Mabel had waved to
Joe from a box at the Polo Grounds that afternoon,
and her presence had nerved him to almost
superhuman exertions. And he had won and won
gloriously.</p>

<p>Would his good luck continue? He was asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
himself this question when the taxicab drew up at
the curb, and he saw that he was at the door of
the Marlborough.</p>

<p>He jumped out and thrust his hand in his pocket
to get the money for his fare, but the chauffeur
waved him back with a grin.</p>

<p>“Nuthin’ doin’,” he said. “This ride is on me.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” inquired Joe in surprise.</p>

<p>“Jest what I said,” returned the chauffeur.
“The fellow that won the championship for the
New Yorks can’t pay me any money. It’s enough
for me to have Baseball Joe ride in my cab. I
can crow over the other fellows that wasn’t so
lucky.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” laughed Joe, as he took out a
bankbill and tried to thrust it on him.</p>

<p>“No use, boss,” the man persisted. “Your
money’s counterfeit with me.”</p>

<p>He started his car with a rush and a backward
wave of his hand, and Joe, warned by a cheer or
two that came from people near by who had recognized
him, was forced to retreat into the hotel.</p>

<p>He did not send up a card, as he was a frequent
caller and felt sure of his welcome. Besides, he
was too impatient for any formalities. He wanted
to be in the presence of Mabel, and even the elevator
seemed slow, though it shot him with amazing
speed to the fifth floor on which the Varley
suite was located.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>His heart was beating fast as he knocked at the
parlor door, and it beat still faster when a familiar
voice bade him enter.</p>

<p>He burst in with a rush that suddenly stopped
short when he saw that he was not the only visitor.
A young man had stepped back quickly from
Mabel’s side and it was evident that he had just
withdrawn his hand from hers.</p>

<p>For a moment Joe’s blood drummed in his ears
and the demon of jealousy took possession of him.
He glared at the visitor, who stared back at him
with an air of insolence that to Joe at that moment
was maddening.</p>

<p>The stranger was dressed in a degree of fashion
that bordered on foppishness. He wore more
jewelry than was dictated by good taste, even going
so far as to carry a tiny wrist watch. His eyes
were pale, his chin slightly retreating, and his face
showed unmistakable marks of dissipation. His
air was arrogant and supercilious as he took Joe
slowly in from head to foot.</p>

<p>Mabel rushed forward eagerly as Joe entered.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe!” she cried. “I’m so glad you’ve come!
I never was so glad in all my life.”</p>

<p>Before the joyous warmth of that greeting,
Joe’s jealousy receded. He could not question her
sincerity. All her soul was in her eyes.</p>

<p>He took her hand tenderly in his and felt that
it was trembling. Had she been frightened? He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
turned her about so that he stood between her and
the visitor.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he commanded in a low voice. “Has
this man offended you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, no, yes!” she whispered. “Oh, Joe,
please don’t say anything now! Please, for my
sake, Joe! It’s all right now. I’ll tell you about
it afterward. He’s Reggie’s friend. Don’t make
a scene, please, Joe!”</p>

<p>Joe’s muscles stiffened, and had it not been for
Mabel’s earnest pleading, he would have thrown
the other fellow out of the room. But Mabel’s
name must not be mixed up in any brawl, and by a
mighty effort he restrained himself.</p>

<p>The visitor during this brief colloquy had been
moving about uneasily. He evidently wished himself
anywhere else than where he was. Then, as
the two turned toward him, he put on a mask of
carelessness and drawled lazily:</p>

<p>“Won’t you introduce me to&mdash;ah&mdash;your friend,
Miss Varley?”</p>

<p>Mabel, recalled to her duty as hostess, had no
option but to comply.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Beckworth Fleming, Joe,” she
said. “Mr. Fleming, this is Mr. Matson.”</p>

<p>The two men bowed coldly but neither extended
a hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fleming is a friend of Reggie’s,” Mabel
explained to Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“And of yours also, I hope, Miss Varley,” said
Fleming with an ingratiating smile.</p>

<p>“I said a friend of Reggie’s,” returned Mabel,
coldly.</p>

<p>It was a direct cut, and Fleming felt it as he
would have felt the lash of a whip. He turned a
dull red and was about to reply, when he caught
the menacing look in Joe’s eyes and stopped. He
muttered something about a pressing engagement,
took up his hat and cane, and with a pretence of
haughtiness that failed dismally of its effect, swaggered
from the room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>GLOWING HOPES</small></h2>


<p>“And now!” exclaimed Joe, as soon as the door
had closed on the unwelcome visitor, “tell me,
Mabel, what that fellow said or did, and I’ll hunt
him up and thrash him within an inch of his life.
I’ll make him wish he’d never been born.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do anything like that, Joe,” urged the
girl. “He’s probably had his lesson, and it isn’t
likely I’ll ever be troubled by him again. He’s
just an acquaintance that Reggie picked up somewhere,
and I’ve only seen him once before to-day.
He called at the hotel to see Reggie, and when he
found he wasn’t in, he stayed to talk with me. He
started in by paying me a lot of compliments and
then became familiar and impudent. He seized
my hand, and when I sought to pull it away from
him he wouldn’t let me. I was getting thoroughly
frightened and was going to call out when your
knock came at the door. Oh, Joe, I was so glad
when I saw who it was!”</p>

<p>She was perilously near to tears, and her beautiful
eyes were dewy as they looked into his. Joe’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
heart beat madly. The words he had been longing
to say leaped to his lips, but he choked them
back. He did not want to catch her off her guard,
to take advantage of her emotions and of her
shaken condition. Her acceptance of him at that
moment might be due in part to gratitude and relief.
He wanted more than that&mdash;the unconditional,
unreserved surrender of her heart and life
into his keeping, based only on affection.</p>

<p>So he held himself under control and recompensed
himself for his selfdenial by an inward
promise to make things interesting for Mr. Beckworth
Fleming, if ever that cad’s path and his
should cross.</p>

<p>“But come,” said Mabel more brightly, as she
sank into a chair and motioned Joe to another,
“let’s talk about something pleasant.”</p>

<p>“About you then,” smiled Joe, his eyes dwelling
on her eloquently.</p>

<p>“Not poor little me,” she pouted in mock humility.
“Who am I compared with the great
Joseph Matson about whom all the world is talking&mdash;the
man who won the championship for the
Giants, the hero whose picture to-morrow will
hold the place of honor in every newspaper in the
country?”</p>

<p>“You’re chaffing me now,” laughed Joe.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” she said demurely, her dimples
coming and going in a way that drove him nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
distracted. “I really feel as though I ought to
salaam or kow-tow or whatever it is the Orientals
do when they come before the Emperor. But, oh,
Joe,” and here she dropped her bantering manner
and leaned forward earnestly, “you were simply
magnificent this afternoon. The way you kept
your nerve and won that game was just wonderful.
I was so excited at times that I thought my
heart would leap out of my body. I was proud,
oh, so proud that you were a friend of mine!”</p>

<p>Joe had heard many words of praise that day
but none half so sweet as these.</p>

<p>“Will you let me tell you a secret?” he exclaimed,
half rising from his chair. “Do you
want to know who really won that game?”</p>

<p>“Why, you did,” she returned in some surprise.
“Of course the rest of the team did, too, but if it
hadn’t been for your pitching and batting&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No,” he interrupted, “it was <em>you</em> who won the
game.”</p>

<p>He had risen now and had come swiftly to her
side.</p>

<p>“Listen, Mabel,” he said, and before the note in
his voice she felt her pulses leap. “You were in
my mind from the start to the finish of that game.
I looked up at you every time I went into the box.
This little glove of yours”&mdash;he took it from his
pocket with a hand that trembled&mdash;“lay close to
my heart all through the game. Mabel&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, hello, Joe, old top!” came a voice
from the door that had opened without their
hearing it. “What good wind blew you here?
I’m no end glad to see you, don’t you know. Congratulations,
old man, on winning that game.
You were simply rippin’, don’t you know.”</p>

<p>And Reggie Varley ambled in and shook Joe’s
hand warmly, blandly unconscious of the lack of
welcome from the two inmates of the room.</p>

<p>“How are you, Reggie?” Joe managed to blurt
out, wishing viciously that at that moment his
friend were at the very farthest corner of the
world.</p>

<p>It is possible that Mabel’s feelings were most
unsisterly, but she concealed them and rallied more
readily than Joe from the shock caused by her
brother’s inopportune coming.</p>

<p>“I was just telling Joe how proud we were of
him,” she smiled. “But he’s so modest that he refuses
to take any credit for what he has done. Insists
that somebody else won the game.”</p>

<p>“Of course that’s all bally nonsense, don’t you
know,” declared Reggie, looking puzzled. “The
other fellows helped, of course, but Joe was the
king pin. Those Chicagos were out for blood and
Joe was the only one who could tame them.”</p>

<p>Joe listened moodily, and while he is recovering
his composure it may be well, for the sake of
those who have not followed the career of the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
young pitcher, to mention the previous books
of this series in which his exploits are recorded.</p>

<p>His diamond history opened in the first volume
of the series, entitled: “Baseball Joe of the Silver
Stars; Or, The Rivals of Riverside.” Here he
had his first experience in pitching. In that restricted
circle he soon became widely known as one
of the best of the amateur boxmen, but he had to
earn that position by overcoming many difficulties.</p>

<p>In “Baseball Joe on the School Nine,” we find
the same qualities of grit and determination shown
in a different field. The situation here was complicated
by the efforts of the bully of the school,
who did everything in his power to frustrate Joe
and bring him to disaster.</p>

<p>A little later on, Joe went to Yale, and his
triumphs in the great university are told in the
third volume of the series, entitled: “Baseball Joe
at Yale; Or, Pitching for the College Championship.”</p>

<p>As may be imagined, with such redoubtable rivals
as Harvard and Princeton, a very different
class of baseball is required from that which will
“get by” in academies and preparatory schools.</p>

<p>Joe got his chance to pitch against Princeton
in an exciting game where the Yale “Bulldog” “put
one over” on the Princeton “Tiger.”</p>

<p>But in spite of his athletic prowess and general
popularity, Joe was not entirely happy at Yale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
His mother had set her heart on Joe’s studying for
the ministry. But Joe himself did not feel any
special call in that direction. While always a
faithful student he was not a natural scholar, and
outdoor life had a strong appeal for him. His
success in athletics confirmed this natural bent,
until at last he came to the conclusion that he
ought to adopt professional baseball as his vocation.</p>

<p>His mother was, naturally, much disappointed,
as she had had great hopes of seeing her only son
in the pulpit. Moreover, she had the vague feeling
that there was something almost disreputable
in making baseball a profession. But Joe at last
convinced her that whatever might have been true
in the early days of the game did not apply now,
when so many high-class men were turning toward
it, and she yielded, though reluctantly.</p>

<p>Joe’s chance to break into the professional
ranks was not long in coming. That last great
game with Princeton had been noted by Jimmie
Mack, manager of the Pittston team in the Central
League. He made Joe an offer which the latter
accepted, and the story of his first experience on
the professional diamond is told in the fourth volume
of the series entitled: “Baseball Joe in the
Central League; Or, Making Good as a Professional
Pitcher.”</p>

<p>But this was only the first step in his career. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was too ambitious to be content with the Central
League except as a stepping stone to something
higher. His delight can be imagined, therefore,
when he learned that he had been drafted into the
St. Louis Club of the National League. He was
no longer a “busher” but the “real thing.” He
had to work hard and had many stirring adventures.
How he succeeded in helping his
team into the first division is told in the fifth
volume of the series, entitled: “Baseball Joe in
the Big League; Or, A Young Pitcher’s Hardest
Struggles.”</p>

<p>But these hard struggles were at the same time
victorious ones and attracted the attention of the
baseball public, who are always on the lookout
for a new star. Among others, McRae, the famous
manager of the New York Giants, thought he
saw in Joe a great chance to bolster up his pitching
staff. Joe could hardly believe his eyes when
he learned that he had been bought by New York.
It brought a bigger reputation, a larger salary and
a capital chance to get into the World Series.
He worked like a Trojan all through the season,
and, as we have already seen, came through with
flying colors, winning from the Chicagos the final
game that made the Giants the champions of the
National League and put them in line for the
championship of the world. The details of the
stirring fight are told in the sixth volume of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
series, entitled: “Baseball Joe on the Giants; Or,
Making Good as a Ball Twirler in the Metropolis.”</p>

<p>“I say, old top,” remarked Reggie, breaking
in on Joe’s rather resentful musings, “you’re going
to stay and have dinner with us to-night, you
know.”</p>

<p>Joe looked at Mabel for confirmation.</p>

<p>“You certainly must, Joe,” she said enthusiastically.
“We won’t take no for an answer.”</p>

<p>As there was nothing else on earth that Joe
wanted so much as to be with Mabel, he did not
require much urging.</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” suggested
Mabel. “In fact, it’s the only thing we can do.
We’ll have the dinner served right in here for the
three of us. If you should go down in the public
dining-room of the hotel to-night, Joe, you’d have
a crowd around the table ten lines deep.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, you’re right,” chimed in Reggie.
“They’d have to send out a call for reserves. I’ll
go down and have a little talk with the head
waiter, and I’ll have him send up a dinner fit for
a king.”</p>

<p>“Fit for a queen,” corrected Joe, as he glanced
at Mabel.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>A POPULAR HERO</small></h2>


<p>Reggie hurried away to order the meal that
was to put the chef on his mettle, leaving Mabel
and Joe once more in possession of the room.</p>

<p>Good-natured, blundering Reggie! Why had
he not waited five minutes longer before breaking
in on that momentous conversation?</p>

<p>To be sure they could have resumed it now, but
Joe felt instinctively that it was not the time.
Cupid is sensitive as to time and place, and the little
blind god is only at his best when assured of
leisure and privacy. His motto is that “two is
company” while three or more are undeniably “a
crowd.”</p>

<p>Reggie might be back at any moment, and then,
too, the waiters would be coming in to spread the
table. So Joe, though sorely against his will, was
forced to wait till fate should be more kind.</p>

<p>But he was in the presence of his divinity anyway
and could feast his eyes upon her as she
chatted gaily, her color heightened by the scene
through which they had just passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>And Mabel was a very delightful object for the
eyes to rest upon. Joe himself, of course, was not
a competent witness. If any one had asked him to
describe her, he would have answered that she was
a combination of Cleopatra and Madame Recamier
and all the other famous beauties of history.
What the unbiased observer would have seen was
a very charming girl, sweet and womanly, with lustrous
brown eyes, wavy hair whose tendrils persisted
in playing hide and seek about her ears, dimples
that came and went in a maddening fashion
and a flower-like mouth, revealing two rows of
pearly teeth when she smiled, which was often.</p>

<p>Even Reggie was moved to compliment her
when he came in again after his interview with the
head waiter.</p>

<p>“My word, Sis, but you’re blooming to-night,
don’t you know,” he remarked, as he went across
the room and put his hand caressingly on her
shoulder. “This little trip must be doing you
good. You’ve got such a splendid color, don’t you
know.”</p>

<p>“Just think of it! A compliment from a
brother! Wonder of wonders!” she laughed merrily.</p>

<p>Perhaps if she had cared to, she might have
enlightened the obtuse Reggie as to the cause of
the heightened color that enhanced her loveliness.
Joe, too, could have made a shrewd guess at it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>But now the waiters came bustling in and they
talked of indifferent things until the table was
spread. A sumptuous meal was brought in, and
the three sat down to as merry a little dinner party
as there was that night in the city of New York.</p>

<p>“How honored we are, Reggie,” exclaimed
Mabel, “to have the great Mr. Matson as our
guest! There are hundreds of people who would
give their eyes for such a chance.”</p>

<p>She flashed a mocking glance at Joe who grew
red, as she knew he would. The little witch delighted
in making him blush. It made his bronzed
face still more handsome, she thought.</p>

<p>“You’d better make the most of it,” Joe grinned
in reply. “I may fall down in the World Series
and be batted out of the box. Then you’ll be pretending
that you don’t know me.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of that,” returned Mabel.
“After the way you pitched this afternoon, I’m
sure there’s nothing in the American League you
need to be afraid of.”</p>

<p>“That’s loyal, anyway,” laughed Joe. “Still
you never can tell. It’s happened to me before
and it may happen again. Then, too, you must
remember that it’s a different proposition I’ll be
up against.</p>

<p>“Take, for instance, the Chicagos to-day. I’ve
pitched against them before and I knew their weak
points. I knew the fellows who can’t hit a high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
ball but are death on the low ones. I knew the
ones who would try to wait me out and those who
would lash out at any ball that came within reach.
I knew the ones who would crowd the plate and
those who would inch in to meet the ball. The
whole problem was to feed them what they didn’t
want.</p>

<p>“But it will be different when I come up against
the American Leaguers. It will be some time before
I catch on to their weak points. And while
I’m learning, one of them may line out a three
bagger or a home run that will win the game.”</p>

<p>“You speak of their weak points as though they
all had them,” put in Reggie.</p>

<p>“They do,” replied Joe, promptly. “All of
them have some weakness, and sooner or later
you find it out. If there’s any exception to that
rule at all, it’s Ty Cobb of Detroit. If he has any
weakness, no one knows what it is. For the last
seven years he’s led the American League in batting,
base stealing and everything else worth while.
All pitchers look alike to him. He’s a perfect terror
to the twirlers.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t have to worry about him,
anyway,” smiled Mabel. “It’s lucky that he’s on
the Detroits instead of the Bostons. For I suppose
it’s the Bostons you’ll have to face in the
World Series.”</p>

<p>“I guess it will be,” answered Joe. “Their season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
doesn’t end until Friday. They’ve had almost
as tight a race in their league as we’ve had in ours,
for the Athletics have been close on their heels.
But the Bostons have to take only one game to
clinch the flag while the Athletics will have to
win every game. So it’s pretty nearly a sure thing
for the Red Sox.”</p>

<p>“Which team would you rather have to fight
against?” asked Reggie.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s pretty near a toss-up,” answered
Joe, thoughtfully. “Either one will be a hard nut
to crack. That one hundred thousand dollar infield
of the Athletics is a stone wall, but I think
the Boston outfield is stronger. That manager of
the Athletics is in a class by himself, and what he
doesn’t know about the game isn’t worth knowing.
He’s liable to spring something on you at any time.
Still the Boston manager is mighty foxy, too, and
you have to keep your eyes open to circumvent
him. Take it all in all, I’d just about as lief face
one team as the other.”</p>

<p>“It will be a little shorter trip for you between
the two cities, if you happen to have the Athletics
for your opponents,” suggested Mabel.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Joe. “In that case we’d have
a good long sleep in regular beds every night,
while on the Boston trip we’d have to put up with
sleeping cars. Still the jumps wouldn’t be big in
either case, and it’s a mighty sight better than if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
we had to go out West for the Chicagos or Detroits.</p>

<p>“From a money point of view the boys are rooting
for Boston to win,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Why, what difference would that make?”
asked Mabel in surprise.</p>

<p>“Because the Boston grounds hold more people
than the Athletics’ park,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“That’s something new to me,” put in Reggie.
“I’ve attended games at both grounds, and it
didn’t seem to me there was much difference between
them.”</p>

<p>“The answer is,” replied Joe, “that we’re not
going to play at Fenway Park, the regular American
League grounds in Boston, in case Boston is
our opponent.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“Because Braves Field, the National League
grounds there, will hold over forty-three thousand
people, and the owners have put it at the disposal
of the American League Club,” Joe answered.</p>

<p>“That’s a sportsmanlike thing to do,” commented
Mabel, warmly.</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” echoed her brother.</p>

<p>“Oh, the days of the old cutthroat policy have
gone by,” said Joe. “The National and American
Leagues used to fight each other like a pair
of Kilkenny cats, but they’ve found that there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
nothing in such a game. This act of the Boston
people shows the new spirit. We saw it, too, when
the grandstand was burned at the Polo Grounds.
The ruins hadn’t got through smoking before the
Yankee management offered the use of its grounds
to McRae as long as he needed them. And then
a little later when the Yankees lost their grounds
because streets were going to be cut through them,
McRae returned the favor by giving them the use
of the Polo Grounds. It’s the right spirit. Fight
like tigers to win games, but outside of that, let live
and wish the other luck.”</p>

<p>“Tell me honestly, Joe, what you think the New
York’s chances are, in case they have to stack up
against Boston,” said Reggie.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Joe, thoughtfully, toying with
his spoon, “if you’d asked me that question a week
ago, I’d have said that New York would win in a
walk. But just now I wouldn’t be anywhere near
so sure of that.”</p>

<p>“You mean the accident to Hughson?” put in
Mabel.</p>

<p>“Exactly that. He was going like a house afire
just before that. You saw what he did to Chicago
in the first game. He had those fellows eating
out of his hand. He was simply unhittable. That
fadeaway of his was zipping along six inches
under their bats. They didn’t have a Chinaman’s
chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then, too, in addition to that splendid pitching
his reputation helps a lot. The minute it is
announced that Hughson is going to pitch, the
other fellows begin to curl up. They’re half
whipped before they start, because they feel that
he has the Indian sign on them, and it’s of no use
to try.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” assented Reggie. “Besides, when
he’s in the box his own team feel they’re in for
a victory and they play like demons behind
him.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to take away a lot of confidence
from our boys,” said Joe, “and in a critical series
like that, confidence is half the battle. We could
have lost two or three other men and yet have a
better chance than we will have with Hughson
out of the game.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any chance of his recovering in
time to take part in some of the games?” asked
Mabel.</p>

<p>“A bare chance only,” Joe replied. “I saw the
old boy yesterday, and he’s getting along surprisingly
fast. You see, he always keeps himself in
such splendid physical condition that he recovers
more quickly than an ordinary man would. We’ve
got over a week yet before the Series starts, and
he may possibly be able to go in before the games
are over. If he does, that will be an immense
help. But McRae had figured on having him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
pitch the first game, so as to get the jump on the
other fellows at the very start. Then he could
have gone in at least twice more, perhaps three
times, and it would have been all over but the
shouting.”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky that McRae has you at hand to step
into Hughson’s shoes,” declared Reggie.</p>

<p>“Step into them!” exclaimed Joe. “Yes, and
rattle around in them. Nobody can fill them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of it,” cried Mabel
warmly&mdash;so warmly in fact that her brother
looked at her in some surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she repeated, holding her ground valiantly,
“I mean just what I say. It’s awfully generous
of you, Joe, to praise Hughson to the skies,
but there’s no use in underrating yourself. I don’t
think Hughson can pitch one bit better than you
can. Look at that game this afternoon. I heard
lots of people around me say that they never saw
such pitching in all their lives. And what you did
to-day you can do again. So there!”&mdash;she caught
herself up, smiling a little confusedly, as though
she had betrayed herself, but finished defiantly&mdash;“if
that be treason, make the most of it.”</p>

<p>Joe’s heart gave a great leap, not only at the
tribute but at the tone and look that had gone
with it. So this was what Mabel thought of him!
This was how she believed in him!</p>

<p>His head was whirling, but in his happy confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
one thought kept pounding away at his consciousness,
a thought that never left him through
all the tremendous test that lay before him:</p>

<p>“I’ve <em>got</em> to make good! I’ve <em>got</em> to make
good!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE SPOILS OF WAR</small></h2>


<p>The rest of the evening flew by as though on
wings, and Joe was startled when he looked at his
watch and found that it was nearly eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go,” he said reluctantly. “I had
no idea it was so late.”</p>

<p>“Why should you hurry?” asked Reggie. “The
season’s over now in the National League, and
the World Series won’t begin for a week or
more. I should think you might have a little leeway
in the matter of sitting up late.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have plenty of leeway before long,”
laughed Joe. “But just now I want to keep in the
very pink of condition. I’ll need every ounce of
strength and vitality I’ve got before I get through
the Series.”</p>

<p>He would have dearly loved a chance for a
few words with Mabel in private before he went
away, but Reggie failed to appreciate that fact,
and he accompanied the pair even when they went
out to the elevator. But Joe avenged himself by
holding Mabel’s hand much longer and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
closely than he had ever dared do before, and the
girl did not dream of calling for help.</p>

<p>But although Joe had been balked in saying
what he had wanted to that night, he felt much
surer of Mabel’s feelings toward him, and his
heart was a tumult of joyous emotions as he made
his way home to the rooms he shared with Jim.</p>

<p>He found Barclay sound asleep, at which he rejoiced.
He was in no mood for chaff and banter.
He wanted to go over in his mind every incident
of that memorable evening&mdash;to recall the tones
of Mabel’s voice, the look in Mabel’s eyes. It
was a delightful occupation and took a good while,
so that it was late when he dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>He was awakened at a much later hour than
usual the next morning by a vigorous tugging at
the shoulder of his pajamas; and, opening one
sleepy eye, saw Jim fully dressed standing at the
side of his bed.</p>

<p>“Go away and let me sleep,” grumbled Joe,
turning over on his pillow for another forty winks.</p>

<p>“For the love of Pete, man! how much sleep
do you want?” snorted Jim. “What are you trying
to do, forget your sorrows? Here it is after
nine o’clock, and I’ve already had my breakfast
and a shave. Get a wiggle on and see what it is
to be a popular hero.”</p>

<p>“Stop your joshing,” muttered Joe, sleepily.</p>

<p>“Josh nothing,” Jim came back at him. “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
you’ll just open those liquid orbs of yours and give
this room the once over, you’ll see whether I’m
joshing or not.”</p>

<p>This stirred Joe’s curiosity and he sat up in bed
with a jerk.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” he exclaimed, as he saw the
room littered with a mass of boxes and packages
that covered every available spot on chairs and
tables and overflowed to the floor. “Where did
you get all this junk? Going to open a department
store?”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll be able to if they keep on coming,”
returned Jim. “I’ve been signing receipts
for express packages until I’ve got the writer’s
cramp. And there’s a pile of letters and telegrams,
and there’s a bunch of reporters down in
the lobby waiting for an interview with your Royal
Highness, and&mdash;but what’s the use? Get up, you
lazy hulk, and get busy.”</p>

<p>“It surely looks as though it were going to be
my busy day,” grinned Joe, as he jumped out of
bed and rushed to the shower.</p>

<p>He shaved and dressed in a hurry and then ate
a hasty breakfast, after which he saw the reporters.</p>

<p>Those clever and wideawake young men greeted
him with enthusiasm and overwhelmed him with
questions that ranged from the date of his birth to
his opinion on the outcome of the World Series.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
They knew that their papers would give them a
free hand in the matter of space, and they were
in search not of paragraphs but of columns from
the idol of the hour.</p>

<p>“You look limp and wilted, Joe,” laughed Jim,
as they went back to their rooms.</p>

<p>“It’s no wonder,” growled Joe. “Those fellows
got the whole sad story of my life. They
hunted out every fact and shook it as a terrier
shakes a rat. They turned me inside out. The
only thing they forgot to ask was when I got my
first tooth and whether I’d ever had the measles.
And, oh, yes, they didn’t find out what was my
favorite breakfast food. But now let’s get busy
on these parcels and see what’s in them.”</p>

<p>“What’s in them is plenty,” prophesied Jim,
“and these are only the few drops before the
shower.”</p>

<p>It was a varied collection of objects that they
took from the packages. There were boxes of
cigars galore, enough to keep the chums in
“smokes” for a year to come. There were canes
and silk shirts and neckties accompanied by requests
from dealers to be permitted to call their
product the “Matson.” There were bottles of
wine and whiskey, which met with short welcome
from these clean young athletes, who took them
over to the bathroom, cracked their necks and
poured the contents down the drain of the washbasin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
until, as Jim declared, the place smelled for
all the world like a “booze parlor.”</p>

<p>“No merry mucilage for ours,” declared Joe,
grimly. “We’ve seen what it did for Hartley, as
clever a pitcher as ever twirled a ball.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” affirmed Jim. “There’s none
of us strong enough to down old John Barleycorn,
and the only way to be safe is never to touch
it.”</p>

<p>After they had gone through the lot and rung
for a porter to carry away the litter of paper and
boxes, they attacked the formidable pile of letters
and telegrams.</p>

<p>Among the former were two offers from vaudeville
managers, urging Joe to go on the stage the
coming winter. They offered him a guarantee of
five hundred dollars a week. They would prepare
a monologue for him, or, if he preferred to
pair up with a partner, they would have a sketch
arranged for him.</p>

<p>“That sounds awfully tempting, Joe,” said Jim,
as they looked up from the letters they had been
reading together.</p>

<p>“It’s a heap of money,” agreed Joe, “and I do
hate to pass it up. But I won’t accept. I’m not an
actor and I know it and they know it. I’d simply
be capitalizing my popularity. I’d feel like a freak
in a dime museum.”</p>

<p>“How do you know you’re not an actor?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Jim. “You might have it in you. You never
know till you try.”</p>

<p>But Joe shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “there’s no use kidding myself.
And even if I could make good, I wouldn’t do it.
You know what it did for Markwith the season
after he made his record of nineteen straight. He
never was the same pitcher after that. The late
hours, the feverish atmosphere, the irregular life
don’t do a ball player any good. They take all
the vim and sand out of him. No vaudeville for
yours truly.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jim, “you’re the doctor. And I
guess you’re right. But it certainly seems hard
to let that good money get away when it’s fairly
begging you to take it.”</p>

<p>The telegrams came from all over the country.
A lot were from Joe’s old team-mates on the St.
Louis club, including Rad Chase and Campbell.
Others were from newspaper publishers offering
fancy prices if Joe would write some articles for
them, describing the games in the forthcoming
World Series. Joe knew perfectly well that this
would entail no time or labor on his part. Some
bright reporter would actually write the articles,
and all Joe needed to do was to let his name be
signed to them as the author. But the practice
was beginning to be frowned upon by the baseball
magnates, and it was in a certain sense a fraud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
upon the public, so that Joe mentally decided in
the negative.</p>

<p>One telegram was far more precious to Joe than
all the others put together. It came from Clara,
his only sister, to whom he was devotedly attached,
and was sent in the name of all the little
family at Riverside. Joe’s eyes were a little moist
as he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dearest love from all of us, Joe. We are
proud of you.”</p></div>

<p>For a long time Joe sat staring at the telegram,
while Jim considerately buried himself in the newspaper
descriptions of yesterday’s great game.</p>

<p>How dear the home folks were! How their
hearts were wrapped up in him and his success!
What a splendid, wholesome influence that cozy
little village home had been in his life. He
thought of his patient, hard-working father, his
loving mother, his winsome sister. He thought of
their quiet, circumscribed life, shut out from the
great currents of the world with which he had become
so familiar.</p>

<p>They were proud of him! Yet all they could
do was to read of his triumphs. They had never
seen him pitch.</p>

<p>He took a sudden resolution.</p>

<p>The home folks were in for one great, big, glorious
fling!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>GETTING READY FOR THE FRAY</small></h2>


<p>“Come along, Jim!” cried Joe, jumping to his
feet. “Put down that old paper and let’s go up
to the Polo Grounds. You know we’ve got to
meet McRae and the rest of the gang there at two
o’clock, and it’s almost one now. We’ll just have
time to get a bite of lunch before we go.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” responded Jim.</p>

<p>They hurried through their lunch and took the
train at the nearest elevated station.</p>

<p>“Some difference to-day from the way we felt
when we were going up yesterday, eh, Joe,”
grinned Jim, as he stretched out his legs luxuriously
and settled back in his seat.</p>

<p>“About a million miles,” assented Joe. “Then
my heart was beating like a triphammer. Then
the work was all to do. Now it’s done.”</p>

<p>“And well done, too, thanks to you,” returned
Jim. “Say, Joe, suppose for a minute&mdash;just <em>suppose</em>
that the Chicagos had copped that game yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t,” protested Joe. “It gives me the cold
shivers just to think of it.”</p>

<p>When they entered the clubhouse, a roar of welcome
greeted them from the members of the team
who were already there. They crowded round
Baseball Joe in jubilation, and the air was filled
with a hubbub of exclamations.</p>

<p>“Here’s the man to whom the team owes fifty
thousand dollars!” shouted the irrepressible Larry
Barrett, the second baseman, who had led the
league that year in batting.</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Joe. “If you owe it to me,
hand it over and I’ll put it in the bank.”</p>

<p>In the laugh that ensued, McRae and Robson,
the inseparable manager and trainer of the Giants,
came hurrying up to Joe. Their faces were beaming
and they looked years younger, now that the
tremendous strain of the last few weeks of the
league race had been taken from their shoulders.</p>

<p>They shook hands warmly.</p>

<p>“You’re the real thing, Joe,” cried Robson.</p>

<p>“You won the flag for us,” declared McRae.
“That home run of yours was a life saver. It
brought home the bacon.”</p>

<p>Joe flushed with pleasure. Praise from these
veterans meant something.</p>

<p>“It took the whole nine to win for us,” he said
modestly.</p>

<p>“Sure it did,” agreed McRae. “The boys put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
up a corking good game. But your pitching held
Brennan’s men down, and it was that scorching hit
that put on the finishing touch.”</p>

<p>“It was the trump that took the trick,” supplemented
Robson.</p>

<p>Denton, the third baseman and wag of the team,
stepped up and gravely put his hands around Joe’s
head as though measuring it.</p>

<p>“Not swelled a bit, boys,” he announced to his
grinning mates. “He can wear the same size hat
that he did yesterday.”</p>

<p>They were all so full of hilarity that it was hard
to get down to serious business, and McRae, who
was as happy as a boy, made no attempt at his
usual rigid discipline.</p>

<p>But when they had at last quieted down a little,
he gathered them about him for a talk about
the forthcoming World Series.</p>

<p>“You’ve done well, boys,” he told them, “and
I’m proud of you. You’ve played the game to the
limit and made a splendid fight. I don’t believe
there’s another team in the league that wouldn’t
have gone to pieces if the same thing had happened
to their crack pitcher that happened to
Hughson. It was a knockout blow, and I don’t
mind admitting to you now that for a time my own
heart was in my boots. But you stood the gaff,
and I want to thank you, both for the owners of
the club and for myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a gratified murmur among the players,
and then Larry shouted:</p>

<p>“Three cheers for McRae, the best manager in
the league!”</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will and the veteran’s
face grew red with pleasure.</p>

<p>“And three more for Robson, the king of trainers!”
cried Jim.</p>

<p>They were given with equal heartiness, and
Robson waved his hand to them with a grin.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we all feel that way,” resumed
McRae, when the tumult had subsided. “If at
times I’ve been a bit hasty with you lads and given
you the rough side of my tongue, it’s been simply
because I was wild with excitement and crazy to
win. And now for the big fight that lies before us.
It’s a great thing to be champions of the National
League. But it’s a greater thing to be champions
of the world.”</p>

<p>A rousing shout rose from the eager group.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ve got it copped already,” cried
Larry.</p>

<p>McRae smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s the right spirit to tackle the job with,”
he replied, “but don’t let the idea run away with
you that it’s going to be an easy thing to do. It
isn’t. Those American Leaguers are tough birds,
and any one who beats them will know he’s been
in a fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“There used to be a time,” he went on, “when
the bulk of the talent was in the National League.
But it isn’t so any longer. They have just as good
batting, just as good pitching and just as good
fielding as we have.</p>

<p>“Of course, we don’t know yet just which team
we’ll have to face, but we may know before night.
If the Bostons win to-day that will settle it. Even
if they lose, provided the Athletics lose, too, the
Red Sox will be the champions. Of course, there’s
nothing sure in baseball, but all the chances are in
favor of the Bostons.</p>

<p>“In any case, it will be an Eastern club, and
that cuts out the matter of the long jumps. But
whichever one it happens to be, it’ll prove a hard
nut to crack.”</p>

<p>“Nut-crackers is our middle name,” murmured
Denton.</p>

<p>“You proved that yesterday,” laughed McRae,
“and you’re going to have a good chance to prove
it again.</p>

<p>“Just as soon as the American race is decided,”
he continued, “and it’s known in what city we are
to play, the National Commission will have a meeting
to fix all the details of the World Series. If
they follow precedent, as they probably will, the
first game will be appointed for a week from this
Friday. They’ll toss a coin to see whether it shall
be here or in the other city. I’m rooting for it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
be here. It’ll give us a better chance to win the
first game if we play it on the home grounds, and
you know what it means to get the jump on the
other fellows.”</p>

<p>“You bet we do!” went up in a chorus.</p>

<p>“Just as soon as it is decided who our opponents
are to be,” the manager resumed, “I’m going to
send some of you fellows out as scouts to see some
of the practice games of the other fellows and get
a line on their style of play. You can pick up a
lot of useful information that way, and we’ve got
so much at stake that we can’t afford to overlook
a single point of the game.”</p>

<p>“How about our own practice?” asked Larry.</p>

<p>“I was coming to that,” replied McRae. “I’m
going to get together just as husky a bunch of sluggers
and fielders as can be found in the National
League.”</p>

<p>He took a sheaf of telegrams from his pocket.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a lot of wires here from every club
in the league, offering the services of any of their
players I want,” he said. “We’ve had our own
fight, and now that it’s over they’re all eager to
help the National League to down the American.
It means a good deal to each of them to have us
come out winner. Even Brennan has offered to
let me have some of the Chicagos to practise
against. I saw him at the hotel last night, and,
although of course he was sore that he didn’t win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
yesterday, he told me I could call upon him for
any men I wanted.”</p>

<p>“He’s a good sport,” ejaculated Jim.</p>

<p>“Sure he is,” confirmed McRae, heartily. “He’s
a hard fighter but he’s as white as they make ’em.”</p>

<p>He consulted a list on which he had jotted down
a few names in pencil.</p>

<p>“How will this do for an All National team to
practise against,” he asked.</p>

<div class="blockquot">“Konetchky, First base.<br />
<span class="ident05">Niehoff, Second base.</span><br />
<span class="ident05">Wagner, Shortstop.</span><br />
<span class="ident05">Zimmermann, Third base.</span><br />
<span class="ident05">Wheat, Left field.</span><br />
<span class="ident05">Carey, Center field.</span><br />
<span class="ident05">Schulte, Right field.</span><br />
<span class="ident05">Pfeffer, Alexander, Pitchers.</span><br />
<span class="ident05">Archer, Gibson, Catchers.”</span></div>

<p>A murmur went up from the players.</p>

<p>“Some sweet hitters!” exclaimed Markwith.</p>

<p>“A bunch of fence breakers,” echoed Jim.</p>

<p>“They’ll give you mighty good practice,”
grinned McRae. “If they can’t straighten out
the curves of you twirlers, nobody can. I’ll have
them all on here in a day or two, and then we’ll
start in training.”</p>

<p>The conference lasted till late in the afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and just as it was breaking up, a telegraphic report
was handed to McRae. He scanned it hastily.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” he exclaimed. “Boston won
to-day, three to two. We’re up against the Red
Sox in the World Series!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>JOE GIVES FAIR WARNING</small></h2>


<p>Although the news only confirmed what had
been all along expected, it was worth a great deal
to the Giants to know certainly just whom they
would have to fight. Their enemy now was detached
from the crowd and out in the open. They
could study him carefully and arrange a clear plan
of campaign.</p>

<p>Joe and Jim were discussing the matter earnestly,
as they passed out of the Polo Grounds to
go downtown.</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s take the elevated,” suggested Joe.
“We haven’t had much exercise, and I want to
stretch my legs a little.”</p>

<p>“I’m agreeable,” replied Jim. “There’s a cool
breeze and it’s a nice night for walking. We can
go part of the way on foot, anyway, and if we feel
like it we’ll hoof it for the whole distance.”</p>

<p>They soon got below the Harlem River and before
long found themselves in the vicinity of Columbus
Circle. They were passing one of the
fashionable cafés that abound in that quarter when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the door opened and a man came out. Joe caught
a good look at his face, and a grim look came into
his eyes as he recognized Beckworth Fleming.</p>

<p>Fleming saw him at the same time, and the eyes
of the two men met in a look of undisguised hostility.
Then with an ugly sneer, Fleming remarked:</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Matson, I believe. Or was it Mr.
Buttinski? I’m not very good at remembering
names.”</p>

<p>“You’ll remember mine if I have to write it on
you with my knuckles,” returned Joe, brought to a
white heat by the insult and the remembrance of
the occurrence of the day before.</p>

<p>“Now, my good fellow&mdash;&mdash;” began Fleming,
a look of alarm replacing his insolent expression.</p>

<p>“Don’t ‘good fellow’ me,” replied Joe. “I
owe you a thrashing and I’m perfectly able to pay
my debts. You’d have gotten it yesterday if we’d
been alone.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t understand you,” stammered Fleming,
looking about him for some way of escape
from the sinewy figure that confronted him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to make myself so clear that
even your limited intelligence can understand me,”
said Joe, grimly. “You keep away from the Marlborough
Hotel. Is that perfectly plain?”</p>

<p>Before the glow in Joe’s eyes, Fleming retreated
a pace or two, but as he caught sight of a policeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
sauntering up toward them, his courage revived.</p>

<p>“I’ll do nothing of the kind,” he snarled.</p>

<p>“You will if you value that precious skin of
yours. I’ve given you fair warning, and you’ll
find that I keep my word.”</p>

<p>By this time the officer had come up close to
them, and Fleming, immensely relieved, turned to
him as an ally.</p>

<p>“Officer, this man has been threatening me with
personal violence,” he complained.</p>

<p>The policeman sized him up quizzically. Then
he looked at Joe and his face lighted up.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Matson. That was a
great game you pitched yesterday,” he ejaculated
in warm admiration.</p>

<p>“I tell you he threatened me,” repeated Fleming,
loudly.</p>

<p>The officer smiled inquiringly at Joe.</p>

<p>“Just a trifling personal matter,” Joe explained
quietly. “He insulted me and I called him down.”</p>

<p>The policeman turned to Fleming.</p>

<p>“Beat it,” he commanded briefly. “You’re
blocking up the sidewalk.”</p>

<p>Fleming bristled up like a turkey cock.</p>

<p>“I’ll have your number,” he said importantly.
“I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“G’wan,” broke in the officer, “or I’ll fan you.
Don’t make me tell you twice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>He emphasized the command by a poke in the
back with his club that took away the last shred of
Fleming’s dignity, and he retreated, with one last
malignant look at Joe.</p>

<p>“I know his kind,” said the officer, complacently.
“One of them rich papa’s boys with more money
than brains. Sorry he bothered you, Mr. Matson.
Are youse boys goin’ to lick them Bostons?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to make a try at it,” laughed Joe.</p>

<p>“You will if you can pitch all the games,” rejoined
the policeman, admiringly. “It cert’nly
was a sin an’ a shame the way you trimmed them
Chicagos. You own New York to-day, Mr. Matson.”</p>

<p>The chums bade him a laughing good-night and
resumed their interrupted stroll.</p>

<p>“Who was that fellow, anyway?” asked Jim in
curiosity.</p>

<p>“His name is Fleming,” answered Joe. “That’s
about all I know of him.”</p>

<p>“How long have you known him?”</p>

<p>“Since yesterday.”</p>

<p>“What was the row all about, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much,” evaded Joe. “I guess we
just don’t like the color of each other’s eyes.”</p>

<p>Jim laughed and did not press the question.
But he had heard the warning to keep away from
the Marlborough Hotel, and could hazard a vague
guess as to the cause of the quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>At their hotel both Joe and Jim found a letter
from the owners of the New York Club waiting
for them. In addition to the informal thanks conveyed
to the team in general by McRae, they had
taken this means of thanking each player personally.
It was a gracious and earnest letter, and
wound up by inviting them to a big banquet and
theatre party that was to be given by the management
to the players in celebration of their great
feat in winning the National League championship
for New York.</p>

<p>But Joe’s letter also contained a little slip from
the Treasurer, to which a crisp, blue, oblong paper
was attached. Joe unfolded it in some wonderment
and ran his eyes over it hastily.</p>

<p>It was a check for a thousand dollars, and on
the accompanying slip was written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In payment of bonus as per contract for
winning twenty games during the season.”</p></div>

<p>Joe grabbed Jim and waltzed him about the
room, much to Barclay’s bewilderment.</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do?” he gasped. “Is
it a new tango step or what?”</p>

<p>“Glory, hallelujah!” ejaculated Joe. “Yesterday
and to-day are sure my lucky days.”</p>

<p>He thrust the check before his friend’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Jim. “It never rains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
but it pours. If you fell overboard, you’d come
up with a fish in your mouth.”</p>

<p>“It sure is like finding money,” chortled Joe.
“Everything seems to be coming my way.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be lending money to Rockefeller if this
sort of thing keeps on,” Jim grinned. “But after
all it can’t be such a surprise. You must have
known that you had won twenty games.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” explained Joe. “I wasn’t sure
of it at all. I figured that with yesterday’s game
I had nineteen. But there was that game in August,
you remember, when I relieved Markwith in
the sixth inning. We won the game, but there
were some fine points in it which made it doubtful
whether it should be credited to Markwith or me.
I had a tip that the official scorers were inclined
to give it to Markwith, and so I had kissed the
game good-bye. But it must be that they’ve decided
in my favor after all and notified the New
York Club to that effect.”</p>

<p>“That’s bully, old man,” cried Jim, enthusiastically.
“And you can’t say that they’ve lost any
time in getting it to you.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Joe. “Ordinarily, they’d settle
with me on the regular salary day. But I suppose
they feel so good over getting the pennant that
they take this means of showing it.”</p>

<p>“They can well afford to do it,” said Jim.
“Your pitching has brought it into the box office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
twenty times over. Still it’s nice and white of them
just the same to be so prompt. That’s one thing
that you have to hand to the Giant management.
There isn’t a club in the league that treats its players
better.”</p>

<p>“You’re just right,” assented Joe, warmly, “and
it makes me feel as though I’d pitch my head off
to win, not only for my own sake but for theirs.”</p>

<p>“You certainly have had a dandy year,” mused
Jim. “With your regular salary of forty-five hundred
and this check in addition you’ve grabbed
fifty-five hundred so far. And you’ll get anywhere
from two to four thousand more in the
World Series.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any kick coming,” agreed Joe. “It
was a lucky day for me when I joined the Giants.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll soak that away in the bank to-morrow,
you bloated plutocrat,” laughed Jim.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” Joe answered promptly. “To-morrow
night that money will be on its way to
Riverside as fast as the train can carry it.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE THOUSAND DOLLAR BANKBILL</small></h2>


<p>The little town of Riverside had been buzzing
with excitement ever since the news had flashed
over the wires that the Giants had won the championship
of the National League. On a miniature
scale, it was as much stirred up as New York itself
had been at the glorious victory.</p>

<p>For was not Joe Matson, who had twirled that
last thrilling game, a son of Riverside? Had he
not grown up among the friends and neighbors
who took such pride and interest in his career?
Had he not, as Sol Cramer, the village oracle and
the owner of the hotel, declared, “put Riverside
on the map?”</p>

<p>There had been a big crowd at the telegraph
office in the little town on the day that the final
game had been played, and cheer after cheer had
gone up as each inning showed that Joe was holding
the Chicagos down. And when in that fateful
ninth his home run had “sewed up” the victory,
the enthusiasm had broken all bounds.</p>

<p>An impromptu procession had been formed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
village band had been pressed into service, the
stores had been cleared out of all the fireworks
left over after the Fourth of July, and practically
the whole population of the town had gathered
on the street in front of the Matson house where
they held a hilarious celebration.</p>

<p>The quiet little family found itself suddenly in
the limelight, and were almost as much embarrassed
as they were delighted by the glory that
Joe’s achievement had brought to them.</p>

<p>The crowd dispersed at a late hour, promising
that this was not a circumstance to what would
happen when Joe himself should come home after
the end of the World Series.</p>

<p>Had any one suggested that possibly the Giants
would lose out in that Series, he would have stood
a good chance of being mobbed. To that crowd
of shouting enthusiasts, the games were already
stowed in the New York bat bag. How could
they lose when Joe Matson was on their team?</p>

<p>In the Matson household joy reigned supreme.
Joe had always been their pride and idol. He had
been a good son and brother, and his weekly letters
home had kept them in touch with every step
of his career. They had followed with breathless
interest his upward march in his profession during
this year with the Giants, but had hardly dared
to hope that his season would wind up in such a
blaze of glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Now they were happy beyond all words. They
fairly devoured the papers that for the next day
or two were full of Joe’s exploits. They could not
stir out of the house without being overwhelmed
with congratulations and questions. Clara, Joe’s
sister, a pretty, winsome girl, declared laughingly
that there could hardly have been more fuss made
if Joe had been elected President of the United
States.</p>

<p>“I’m sure he’d make a very good one if he
had,” said Mrs. Matson, complacently, as she bit
off a thread of her sewing.</p>

<p>“You dear, conceited Momsey,” said Clara,
kissing her.</p>

<p>Mr. Matson smiled over his pipe. He was a
quiet, undemonstrative man, but in his heart he
was intensely proud of this stalwart son of his.</p>

<p>“How I wish we could have seen that game!”
remarked Clara, wistfully. “Just think, Momsey,
of sitting in a box at the Polo Grounds and seeing
that enormous crowd go crazy over Joe, <em>our</em>
Joe.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid my heart would almost break with
pride and happiness,” replied her mother, taking
off her glasses and wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s great, reading all about it in the
papers and seeing the pictures,” continued Clara,
“but that isn’t like actually being there and hearing
the shouts and all that. But I’m a very wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
girl to want anything more than I’ve got,” she
went on brightly. “Now I’m going to run down
to the post-office. The mail must be in by this
time and I shouldn’t wonder if I’d find a letter
from Joe.”</p>

<p>She put on her hat and left the house. Mrs.
Matson looked inquiringly at her husband.</p>

<p>“You heard what Clara said, dear,” she observed.
“I don’t suppose there’s any way in the
world we could manage it, is there?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” returned Mr. Matson. “I’ve
had to spend more money than I expected in perfecting
that invention of mine. But there’s nothing
in the world that I would like more than to see
Joe pitch, if it were only a single game.”</p>

<p>Clara soon reached the little post-office and
asked for the Matson mail. There were several
letters in their box, but none from Joe.</p>

<p>She was much disappointed, as in Joe’s last
telegram he had told her that a letter was on the
way and to look out for it.</p>

<p>She had turned away and was going out of the
office, when the postmaster called her back.</p>

<p>“Just wait a minute,” he said. “I see I’ve
got something for you here in the registered
mail.”</p>

<p>He handed her a letter which Clara joyfully
saw was addressed in Joe’s handwriting.</p>

<p>“It’s directed to your mother,” the postmaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
went on, “but of course it will be all right if you
sign for it.”</p>

<p>Clara eagerly signed the official receipt and
hurried home with her precious letter.</p>

<p>“Did you get one from Joe?” asked her mother,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t anything from him in the box,”
said Clara, trying to look glum. Then as she saw
her mother’s face fall, she added gaily: “But here’s
one that the postmaster handed me. It came in
the registered mail.”</p>

<p>She handed it over to her mother, who took it
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Hurry up and open it, Momsey!” cried Clara,
fairly dancing with eagerness. “I’m just dying
to know what Joe has to say.”</p>

<p>Mr. Matson laid aside his pipe and came over
to his wife. She tore open the letter with fingers
that trembled.</p>

<p>Something crisp and yellow fluttered out and
fell on the table. Clara’s nimble fingers swooped
down upon it.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a bankbill!” she exclaimed as she unfolded
it. “A ten dollar bill it looks like. No,”
as her eyes grew larger, “it’s more than that. It’s
a hundred&mdash;<a href="#image02">Why, why,” she stammered, “it’s <em>a
thousand dollar bill</em>!</a>”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_56">“WHY, WHY,” SHE STAMMERED, “IT’S A THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL!”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Goodness sakes!” exclaimed her mother. “It
can’t be. There aren’t any bills as big as that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Matson took it and scrutinized it closely.</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” he pronounced in a voice
that trembled a little. “It’s a thousand dollar
bill.”</p>

<p>The members of the little family stared at each
other. None of them had ever seen a bill like
that before. They could hardly believe their
eyes. They thought that they were dreaming.</p>

<p>Mrs. Matson began to cry.</p>

<p>“That blessed, blessed boy!” she sobbed.
“That blessed, darling boy!”</p>

<p>Clara’s eyes, too, were full of tears, and Mr.
Matson blew his nose with astonishing vigor.</p>

<p>But they were happy tears that did not scald
or sting, and in a few minutes they had recovered
their equanimity to some degree.</p>

<p>“What on earth can it all mean?” asked Mrs.
Matson, as she put on her glasses again.</p>

<p>“Let’s read the letter and find out,” urged
Clara.</p>

<p>“You read it, Clara,” said her mother. “I’m
such a big baby to-day that I couldn’t get through
with it.”</p>

<p>Clara obeyed.</p>

<p>The letter was not very long, for Joe had had
to dash it off hurriedly, but they read a good deal
more between the lines than was written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dearest Momsey,” the communication ran, “I
am writing this letter in a rush, as I’m fearfully
busy just now, getting ready for the World
Series. Of course, you’ve read by this time all
about the last game that won us the pennant. I
had good luck and the boys supported me well so
that I pulled through all right.</p>

<p>“Now don’t think, Momsey, when you see the
enclosed bill that I’ve been cracking a bank or
making counterfeit money. I send the money in
a single bill so that it won’t make the registered
letter too bulky. Dad can get it changed into
small bills at the bank.</p>

<p>“You remember the clause in my contract by
which I was to get a thousand dollars extra if I
won twenty games during the season? Well, that
last game just made the twentieth, and the club
handed the money over in a hurry. And in just
as much of a hurry I’m handing it over to the
dearest mother any fellow ever had.</p>

<p>“Now, Momsey, I want you and Dad and Clara
to shut up the house, jump into some good clothes
and hustle on here to New York just as fast as
steam will bring you. You’re going to see the
World Series, take in the sights of New York
and Boston, and have the time of your life. You’re
going to have one big <em>ga-lorious spree</em>!</p>

<p>“Now notice what I’ve said, Momsey&mdash;<em>spree</em>.
Don’t begin to figure on how little money you can
do it with. You’ve been trying to save money all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
your life. This one time I want you to <em>spend</em> it.
Doll yourself up without thinking of expense, and
see that that pretty sister of mine has the best
clothes that money can buy. Don’t put up lunches
to eat on the way. Live on the fat of the land in
the dining cars. Don’t come in day coaches, but
get lower berths in the Pullmans. Make the
Queen of Sheba look like thirty cents. I want you,
Momsey dear, to have an experience that you can
look back upon for all your life.</p>

<p>“I’ve engaged a suite of rooms for you in the
Marlborough Hotel&mdash;a living room, two bedrooms
and a private bath. Reggie Varley and
Mabel are stopping there now, and they’ll be delighted
to see you. They often speak of the good
times they had with you when they were at Riverside.
And you know how fond Clara and Mabel
are of each other.</p>

<p>“Tell Sis that Jim Barclay, my chum, has seen
her picture and is crazy to meet her. He’s a
Princeton man, a splendid fellow, and I wouldn’t
mind a bit having him for a brother-in-law.”</p></div>

<p>“The idea!” exclaimed Clara, tossing her
pretty head and blushing like a rose, but looking
not a bit displeased, nevertheless.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Now don’t lose a minute, Momsey, for the
time is short and the Series begins next week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
You’ll have to do some tall hustling. Wire me
what train you’ll take, and I’ll be there with bells
on to meet you and take you to the hotel.</p>

<p>“Am feeling fine. Best love to Dad and Sis
and lots for yourself from</p>

<p class="noic">“Your loving son,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Joe</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>There was silence in the room for a moment
after Clara finished reading. They looked at
each other with hearts beating fast and eyes shining.</p>

<p>“New York, Boston, the World Series!” Clara
gasped in delight. “Pinch me, Dad, to see if
I’m dreaming! Oh, Momsey!” she exclaimed
as she danced around the room, “Joe put it just
right. It’s going to be a ‘<em>ga-lorious spree</em>!’”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>RECKLESS DRIVING</small></h2>


<p>In New York, the preparation for the World
Series was rapidly taking form. Little else was
thought or spoken of. Pictures of the teams and
players usurped the front pages of the newspapers,
crowding all other news into the background.
For the time being the ballplayer was
king.</p>

<p>It was generally agreed by the experts that the
contest would be close. Neither side could look
for a walkover. The fight would be for blood
from the very start.</p>

<p>On paper the teams seemed pretty evenly
matched. If the Red Sox were a little quicker in
fielding, the Giants seemed to have “the edge” on
their opponents in batting. It was felt that the
final decision would be made in the pitcher’s
box.</p>

<p>And here the “dope” favored the Red Sox.
This was due chiefly to the accident that had befallen
Hughson. Had that splendid veteran been
in his usual shape, it was conceded that New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ought to win and win handsomely. For Boston
could not show a pair to equal Hughson and Matson,
although the general excellence of their staff
was very high.</p>

<p>But with Hughson out of the Series, it looked
as though Joe’s shoulders would have to bear the
major part of the pitching burden; and though
those shoulders were sturdy, no one man could
carry so heavy a load as that would be.</p>

<p>Thus the problem of New York’s success
seemed to resolve itself into this: Would Hughson
have so far recovered as to take part in the
games? And behind this was still another question:
Even if he should take part, would he be up
to his usual form after the severe ordeal through
which he had passed?</p>

<p>So great was the anxiety on this score that almost
every new edition of the afternoon papers
made a point of publishing the very latest news
of the great pitcher’s condition. Most of these
were reassuring, for Hughson really was making
remarkable progress, and it goes without saying
that, regardless of cost, he was receiving the very
best attention from the most skilful specialists
that could be secured.</p>

<p>In the meantime the National Commission&mdash;the
supreme court in baseball&mdash;had met in conclave
at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.
They really had little to do, except to reaffirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the rules which had governed previous Series and
had been found to work well in practice.</p>

<p>The Series was to consist of seven games, to
be played alternately on succeeding days in the
two cities. The place where the games were to
start would be decided by the toss of a coin. If
rain interfered with any of the games, the game
was to be played in the same city on the first fair
day.</p>

<p>The Series was to finish when either of the
teams had won four games. Only in the first four
games played were the players to share in the
money paid to see them. This provision was
made so that there should be no temptation for
the players to “spin out” the Series in order to
share additional receipts. It was up to each team
to win four straight games if it could.</p>

<p>Of the money taken in at these first four games,
ten per cent. was to go to the National Commission
and ten per cent. into the clubs’ treasuries.
The balance was to be divided between the two
teams in the proportion of sixty per cent. to the
winner and forty per cent. to the loser.</p>

<p>The players had no financial interest whatever
in any money taken in at other games, which went
to the clubs themselves, less the percentage of the
National Commission.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Jim Barclay in delight, as he
broke into the rooms occupied by Joe and himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Joe, looking up.
“Dropped into a fortune? Got money from
home?”</p>

<p>“We’ve won the toss of the coin!” ejaculated
Jim. “New York gets the first game.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Joe. “That’s all to the good.
That’s the first break in the game and it’s come
our way. Let’s hope that luck will stay with us
all through.”</p>

<p>“And just as we supposed, the first game will
start on Friday,” continued Jim. “So that we’ll
have about a week for practice before we have to
buckle to the real work.”</p>

<p>“McRae told me this morning that he had almost
all the practice team together now, and that
we’d start to playing against them on Monday,”
said Joe.</p>

<p>“It’s up to us to make the most of this little
breathing spell, then,” returned Jim. “I think I’ll
take a little run down to the beach to-morrow.
Care to come along?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got an engagement myself to-morrow,”
Joe replied. “I’m going for an automobile ride
with Reggie Varley and Miss Varley. By the
way, Jim, why don’t you come along with us?
Reggie told me to bring along a friend if I cared
to. There’s plenty of room, and he has a dandy
auto. Flies like a bird. Come along.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Out on Long Island somewhere. Probably
stop at Long Beach for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ll come,” said Jim readily. “But don’t
think I’m not on to your curves, you old rascal.
You want me to engage Reggie in conversation so
that you can have Miss Varley all to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” disclaimed Joe, flushing a trifle.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the astute Jim, “I’ll let you
have the front seat with Reggie, while I sit back
in the tonneau.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life you won’t!” said Joe, driven
out into the open.</p>

<p>“All right,” grinned Jim resignedly. “I’ll be
the goat. When do we start?”</p>

<p>“Reggie will have the car up in front of the
Marlborough at about ten, he said. We’ll have
a good early start and make a day of it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jim. “Let’s root for good
weather.”</p>

<p>They could not have hoped for a finer day than
that which greeted them on the following morning.
The sun shone brightly, but there was just
enough fall crispness to make the air fresh and
delicious.</p>

<p>Reggie was on time, nor did Mabel avail herself
of the privilege of her sex and keep them
waiting. The girl looked bewitching in her new
fall costume and the latest thing in auto toggery,
and her rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes drew Joe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
more deeply than ever into the toils. Jim’s mischievous
glance at them as they settled back in
the tonneau while he took his seat beside Reggie,
left no doubt in his own mind how matters stood
between them.</p>

<p>Whatever else Reggie lacked, he was a master
hand at the wheel, and he wound his way in and
out of the thronging traffic with the eye and hand
of an expert. They soon reached and crossed the
Queensboro Bridge, and then Reggie put on increased
speed and the swift machine darted like
a swallow along one of the magnificent roads in
which the island abounds. Beautiful Long Island
lay before them, dotted with charming homes and
rich estates, fertile beyond description, swept by
ocean breezes, redolent of the balsam of the
pines, “fair as a garden of the Lord.”</p>

<p>Jim, like the good fellow and true friend that
he was, absorbed Reggie’s attention&mdash;that is, as
much of it as could be taken from the road that
unrolled like a ribbon beneath the flying car&mdash;and
Joe and Mabel were almost as much alone as
though they had had the car to themselves. And
it was very evident that neither was bored with
the other’s society. Joe’s hand may have brushed
against Mabel’s occasionally, but that was doubtless
due to the swaying of the car. At any rate,
Mabel did not seem to mind.</p>

<p>At the rate at which they were going, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
only a little while before they heard the sound of
the breakers, and the great hotel at Long Beach
loomed up before them.</p>

<p>Reggie put up his car and they spent a glorious
hour on the beach, watching the white-capped
waves as they rushed in like race horses with
crested manes and thundered on the sands. Then
they had a choice and carefully selected dinner
served in full view of the sea.</p>

<p>“Some hotel, this,” remarked Reggie as he
gazed about him. “Make a dent in a man’s
pocketbook to live here right along.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jim. “They give you the best
there is, but you have to pay the price. Reminds
me of a story that used to be told of a famous
hotel in Washington. The proprietor was known
among statesmen all over the country for the way
he served beefsteak smothered in onions. One
man who had tried the dish advised his friend to
do the same the next time he went to Washington.”</p>

<p>“But onions!” exclaimed his friend with a shudder.
“Think of one’s breath.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” replied the other. “When
you get the bill it will take your breath away.”</p>

<p>Reggie laughed, and, as the afternoon was getting
on, ordered the car to be brought around.
They had thought to go out along the south shore
as far as Patchogue, before turning about for
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>They were bowling along on the Merrick Road
in the vicinity of Bay Shore, when an automobile
behind them came rushing past at a reckless rate
of speed. It almost grazed Reggie’s car, and the
quick turn he was obliged to make came within
an ace of sending the car into a ditch.</p>

<p>“My word!” cried the indignant Reggie.
“Those bally beggars ought to be pinched. A
little more and they’d have smashed us.”</p>

<p>“Half drunk, most likely,” commented Jim.
“They’ll kill somebody yet if they keep that up.
By Jove, I believe they’ve done it now!”</p>

<p>From up the road came a chorus of yells and
shouts. They saw the flying automobile hesitate
for a moment and then plunge on, leaving a limp
and motionless form sprawled out in the road behind
it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>A BRUTAL ACT</small></h2>


<p>There was a shout from the men and a scream
of terror from Mabel.</p>

<p>“Oh, hurry, hurry!” she urged. “Perhaps
they’ve killed him!”</p>

<p>Reggie needed no urging, and in a moment more
they had come within a few feet of the figure that
still lay without motion or any sign of life.</p>

<p>Joe and Jim were out of the car like a flash and
ran to the side of the victim.</p>

<p>Reggie turned the car into a piece of open
woodland at the side of the road, and then he and
Mabel descended and joined the others.</p>

<p>The man who had been hit seemed to be nearly
seventy years old. His hair was silvery white, except
where it was dabbled with blood that flowed
from a wound in his head near the left temple.
His clothing was shabby and covered with dust.
A G. A. R. button was on the lapel of his coat.</p>

<p>As Joe knelt down and lifted the man’s head
to his knee, the latter opened his eyes and gave
utterance to a groan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim, who had a rough knowledge of surgery
from his experience with the accidents that are
constantly happening on the ball field, ran his
hands deftly over the prostrate form.</p>

<p>“Don’t seem to be any bones broken,” he announced
after a moment. “And that cut on the
head seems to have come when he struck the road.
But let’s carry him over to this patch of grass and
bind up his head to stop that bleeding.”</p>

<p>The handkerchiefs of the party were called into
requisition and torn into strips from which a
bandage was improvised. There was a small
brook near by, and Mabel hurried to this for
water, with which she bathed the man’s head and
face.</p>

<p>“We’d better get him into the car and carry
him on to Bay Shore,” said Joe, when they had
done all they could. “I don’t imagine he’s fatally
hurt, although at his age the shock may make it
serious.”</p>

<p>Just then the man stirred feebly and his eyes
opened. There was a puzzled expression as he
gazed into the faces surrounding him, and then
a look of comprehension as he recalled the fact of
the accident.</p>

<p>“Was it your car that hit me?” he asked. “But
no, I know it wasn’t,” he added, as he caught sight
of Mabel. “There wasn’t any woman in that machine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t try to talk,” admonished Joe gently.
“You’ve had a bad shake-up, but there are no
bones broken and you’ll be as good as ever in a
little while.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t give me a dog’s chance,” the old
man murmured wearily. “They must have seen
me coming, but they didn’t honk their horn or give
me any warning. They were fooling and laughing,
and the car was zigzagging as though the
driver was half drunk. An old man like me doesn’t
count, I guess, with a bunch of joy riders. Did
they stop afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Not a second,” declared Jim angrily. “They
rushed on without even looking behind. They’re
not much better than a bunch of murderers.”</p>

<p>“I wish we’d got their number,” Joe gritted
savagely between his teeth. “I tried to, but they
were raising such a cloud of dust that I only caught
the numbers seven and four as part of their license
number. And that isn’t enough to go by.”</p>

<p>“They ought to be made to pay handsomely for
the outrage,” declared Mabel indignantly.</p>

<p>“We’ll telephone to the towns ahead when we
get to Bay Shore, describing them as well as we
can, and try to have them arrested,” said Joe.
“But now we must get to a doctor or a hospital.
This man ought to be attended to at once.”</p>

<p>Joe and Jim lifted the old man carefully and
placed him, half sitting, half lying, in the tonneau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of the car. The others crowded in as they were
able, and Reggie threw in his clutch and started
on the way to Bay Shore.</p>

<p>Here on making inquiries they found that there
was a large hospital at Islip, not far away, and in
a few minutes they were at the doors of the big
institution.</p>

<p>A preliminary examination showed that the
wound on the head was a superficial one and that
the old man was suffering chiefly from shock. He
was put to bed in a cool private room that Joe
made himself responsible for, and the doctor predicted
that in a few days he would be on his feet
again and able to return to his home.</p>

<p>This, they had learned from him, was Boston.
His name was Louis Anderson. He was in poor
circumstances and his visit to Long Island had
been for the purpose of disposing of a tiny bit of
property which represented his last earthly possession.</p>

<p>“I can’t thank you boys enough,” he said, as
they at last prepared to leave. “I only wish there
was something I could do for you in return. I
don’t suppose you often get to Boston.”</p>

<p>“We expect to get there several times within
the next week or two,” remarked Joe, as he looked
at Jim with an amused twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Then you must be traveling men,” suggested
Anderson. “What line are you in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“The baseball line,” grinned Jim.</p>

<p>“And you’re going to Boston?” repeated Anderson.
“Why, then you must be members of the
Giants and going to play in the World Series.”</p>

<p>“Guessed it right,” Jim responded.</p>

<p>“If I didn’t hate to root against Boston, I’d
almost wish you’d win, after all you’ve done for
me,” Louis Anderson smiled feebly.</p>

<p>“We’re going to try mighty hard,” Joe assured
him.</p>

<p>“They say that fellow Matson of yours is the
king of them all,” the old man went on.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” responded Joe gravely.
“I’ve known him to pitch some rotten ball.”</p>

<p>They shook hands and went away, promising
to keep in touch with him and do all they could
to find the reckless automobilists who had caused
his injuries.</p>

<p>But although they gave the facts to the village
authorities and had a notice sent out to other
towns in the car’s path, they had little hope that
anything would come of it.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ve made a clean getaway of it,”
judged Jim, as they once more headed toward
the city.</p>

<p>“It’s a burning shame,” commented Mabel.
“He seems to be such a nice old man, too. The
idea of those men not even stopping to see what
they could do for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“He might have died in the road for all they
cared,” declared Reggie indignantly. “A good
long jail sentence would teach those bounders a
little decency, by Jove!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have them soaked heavily for
damages,” observed Joe. “I don’t think the old
man would have much trouble in getting a heavy
verdict in his favor from a jury. And I guess the
poor old fellow needs all he can get.”</p>

<p>The knowledge, however, that the accident
would not prove fatal and the consciousness that
they had done all they could to help, served to
dissipate the shock caused by the affair, and before
long they were chatting as merrily as ever. So
that when at last they parted at the doors of the
Marlborough their only feeling of regret was that
the day was ended. As for Joe and Mabel,
snugly ensconced in the tonneau, they would have
been willing to ride on forever. Joe said as much,
and Mabel had acquiesced with her eyes if not in
words.</p>

<p>It was a discordant note, therefore, when as
the chums were going toward their rooms they
almost ran into “Bugs” Hartley, the former
pitcher of the Giants, who had been released
earlier in the season for dissipation.</p>

<p>That erratic individual, whose venom against
Joe had once led him to drug his coffee so that
our hero might be unable to pitch, had rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
gone from bad to worse. He had exceptional
ability when he kept sober, and even after his
release by McRae he could have found some other
manager willing to give him a chance if he had
kept away from drink. But he had gone steadily
downhill until he was now a saloon lounger and
hanger-on.</p>

<p>He had been drinking heavily now, as was evident
by a glance at his bleared face, and had
reached the ugly stage of intoxication. His former
team mates stepped back as he lurched against
them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Hartley,” said Joe not unkindly, for
despite his just cause for resentment, he was
shocked and sorry to see how low “Bugs” had
fallen.</p>

<p>“Don’t you talk to me!” snarled Hartley viciously.
“You got me off the team and knocked
me out of my chance of World Series money.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong there, Bugs,” returned Joe,
keeping his temper. “I did everything I could to
help you. When you were drunk in St. Louis, Jim
and I smuggled you off to bed so that McRae
wouldn’t find it out. You’re your own worst
enemy, Bugs.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you brace up, Bugs, and cut out
the booze?” broke in Jim. “You’ve got lots of
good pitching left in you yet.”</p>

<p>“Quit your preaching, you guys,” growled Hartley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
thickly. “It doesn’t work with me. You’ve
done me dirt and I’m going to get even with you
yet and don’t you forget it.”</p>

<p>He moved away unsteadily, and the chums
watched him with a sentiment of pity.</p>

<p>“Poor old Bugs,” remarked Jim. “He can’t
bat successfully against the Demon Rum.”</p>

<p>“No,” assented Joe. “I’m afraid he’ll be struck
out.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>THE OPENING GUN</small></h2>


<p>The practice games of the next few days were
by no means tame affairs, even though there was
nothing especially at stake.</p>

<p>The All-National team was, as has been seen,
chosen from among the stars of the profession,
and though they lacked, of course, the team work
of the Giants, they gave the latter all they could
do to hold their own. They had been ordered to
“tear things wide open” and play the game for
all it was worth.</p>

<p>This they proceeded to do with such effect that
when the time for the great Series arrived the
Giants had been put on their mettle and were at
the very top of their form.</p>

<p>It had been an especially busy week for Joe.
He had spent one day in Boston, to which city he
had run over on the midnight train at the direction
of McRae, in order that he might observe
the practice of the Red Sox and get a line on their
batters. He had been impressed but not dismayed
by their show of strength, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
come back knowing that his work was cut out for
him.</p>

<p>He had taken advantage, too, of his presence in
Boston to arrange for rooms for his family, as
well as for Reggie and Mabel, as they expected
to go back and forth during the fateful week the
Series lasted on the same trains taken by the two
teams.</p>

<p>Thursday was made memorable to the New
Yorks by the appearance of Hughson. There was
an affectionate roar and rush for the veteran as
he came into the clubhouse among his adoring
mates.</p>

<p>To the torrent of questions poured out on him
as to his condition, he responded that he was feeling
fine physically, but was not yet sure of his arm.
His shoulder was still somewhat lame and tender,
but he hoped to get into some of the games later
on. He tossed the ball about for a little while,
but made no attempt to cut loose with any curves
or fast ones. But the very sight of their crack
pitcher once more in uniform was a tonic and
inspiration to his mates, and they put an amount
of “ginger” into their practice game that afternoon
that was full of promise to McRae and Robson,
as they watched their men from the side lines.</p>

<p>“I think we’re going to cop the Series, Robbie,”
declared the former when the practice was over.
“The men are as full of pep as so many colts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“They certainly look good to-day, John,” was
the response. “But I’d give a thousand dollars
out of my pocket at this minute if Hughson was in
shape.”</p>

<p>That evening Joe’s parents and sister reached
New York. Joe had received a wire telling him
on what train they were coming and was at the
station to meet them, full of affection and impatience.</p>

<p>He scanned eagerly the long train as it rolled
into the station. Then he detected the familiar
figures descending the steps of a Pullman coach,
and in a moment more there was a joyful family
reunion.</p>

<p>“Momsey&mdash;Dad!” he cried, grasping his
father’s hand and kissing his mother, who had all
she could do to keep from throwing her arms
around his neck then and there. “And Sis, you
darling! Sweet and pretty as a picture!” he exclaimed,
holding her out at arms’ length so that
he could look at her sparkling face. “Poor, poor
Jim!” he teased. “I see his finish!”</p>

<p>Clara’s color deepened, but before she could
retort, Joe was hurrying the little party through
the crowd to the street, where he hailed a taxicab
and had them whirled away to their rooms at the
Marlborough.</p>

<p>He had arranged to have a nice supper served
in their suite that night, as he knew that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
would be tired and excited after their long journey.
So they dined cosily and happily, and the
hour or two of dear familiar talk that followed
marked one of the happiest experiences the united
little family had ever known.</p>

<p>But Joe could not stay nearly as long as he
wanted to, for to-morrow was the day of the first
game and he had to retire early so as to be in
perfect condition.</p>

<p>McRae had told Joe that afternoon that he was
slated to pitch the opening game.</p>

<p>“I’m banking on you, Joe,” the manager told
him. “You’ve never failed me yet, and I don’t
think you’ll do it now. If you fall down, we’re
dead ones.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my very best,” declared Joe earnestly.</p>

<p>“Your best is good enough for any one,” replied
McRae. “Just show them the same stuff
you did the Chicagos in that last game and I won’t
ask for anything more.”</p>

<p>The next morning dawned bright and clear, and
the city was agog with expectation. New York,
usually so indifferent to most things, had gone
wild over the Series. The morning papers bore
the flaring headlines: “<em>Matson Pitches the First
Game</em>.” Crowds gathered early about the bulletin
boards. Long before the time set for the game,
cars and trains disgorged their living loads at the
gates of the Polo Grounds, and before the teams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
came out for practice the grandstands and bleachers
were black with swarming, jostling humanity.
The metropolis was simply baseball mad.</p>

<p>Within the gates, hundreds of special officers
lined the field to keep order and prevent the overflow
back of centerfield from encroaching on the
playing space. The Seventh Regiment Band
played popular airs. Movie men were here, there
and everywhere, getting snapshots of the scene.
The diamond lay like so much green velvet under
the bright sun, and the freshly marked white base
lines stood out in dazzling contrast. It was a
scene to stir to the depths any lover of the great
national game.</p>

<p>There was a thunderous roar as the teams
marched down from the clubhouse, and there were
bursts of applause for the sparkling plays that
marked the preliminary practice. Then the field
was cleared, the gong rang and the umpire, taking
off his hat and facing the stands, bellowed in stentorian
tones:</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen: The batteries for to-day’s
game are Fraser and Thompson for Boston,
Matson and Mylert for New York.”</p>

<p>Loud applause followed, and this grew into a
cyclone when Joe took the ball tossed to him and
walked toward the pitcher’s box.</p>

<p>“Matson! Matson! Matson!” yelled the
crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe cast a swift look at the box where his family
were seated with Mabel and Reggie. Then
he touched a little glove that rested in a pocket
of his uniform.</p>

<p>The head of the Red Sox batting order had
taken up his position at the plate.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>Joe straightened up to his full height, wound up
deliberately, and the ball shot over the corner of
the plate like a bullet. The batter lunged at it
savagely, but only hit the air.</p>

<p>The crowd yelled its delight at the auspicious
beginning.</p>

<p>“That’s the way, Joe!”</p>

<p>“He can’t touch you!”</p>

<p>“Missed it by a mile!”</p>

<p>A ball followed, then a foul, then another ball,
and a final strike that sent the batter discomfited
to the bench.</p>

<p>The next man up raised a towering skyscraper,
which Larry gathered in without moving from his
tracks, and the third man died, as had the first, on
strikes.</p>

<p>The half inning had been short and sharp, and
Joe met a tempest of encouraging cheers as he
walked in to the bench.</p>

<p>“You’ve got their number, old man!”</p>

<p>“They’ll break their backs trying to hit
you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some bad pitching, I don’t think!”</p>

<p>But Joe had had too much experience to be
betrayed into any undue elation. There were
eight innings more to come and in that time many
things might happen.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>SNATCHED FROM THE FIRE</small></h2>


<p>Not a bit dismayed by their unpromising beginning,
the Red Sox took the field, and speedily
showed that they too could uncork a brand of
pitching that was not to be despised.</p>

<p>The best that Burkett could do was to raise a
“Texas Leaguer” that Berry gobbled in without
any trouble. Larry chopped an easy one to Girdner,
who got him at first with plenty to spare.
Denton dribbled a slow roller that Fraser gathered
in on the first base line, tagging the runner as
he passed.</p>

<p>And now it was the turn of the Boston enthusiasts,
of whom thousands had made the trip to
see their favorites play, to yell frantically for the
Red Sox.</p>

<p>Joe realized at once that he had a foeman in
Fraser who was worthy of his steel, and knew that
all his skill and cunning would be required to win.</p>

<p>For the next two innings the sides were mowed
down with unfailing regularity, and not a man on
either side reached first base. It looked as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the game were going to resolve itself into a pitchers’
duel, and the crowds were breathless with
excitement as batter after batter was sent to the
bench.</p>

<p>The Giants broke the ice in the fourth. Burkett
scorched a single to right, and by daring base-running
stretched it to a double, as Cooper was
slow in making the return. Barrett sacrificed him
to third. Fraser put on steam and fanned Denton
on strikes. Then Willis came to the rescue with
a sizzling hit just inside the third base line, and
Burkett came galloping over the plate with the
first run of the game.</p>

<p>The crowd rose and cheered wildly, and the
Giants from their dugout threw their caps in the
air and gathered around Burkett in jubilation. It
was only one run, but the way the game was going
that run looked as big as a mountain.</p>

<p>Willis was caught napping off first by a snap
throw from Thompson to Hobbs, and the inning
ended.</p>

<p>The fifth was devoid of scoring, but in the
sixth the Bostons not only tied the Giants but
passed them.</p>

<p>Loomis, the crack left fielder of the visitors,
started the trouble with a sharp hit to Larry, who
“booted” the ball, letting Loomis get to first.
Hobbs lay down a bunt on which Joe had no time
to get Loomis at second, though he tossed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Hobbs at first. Walters lined out the first clean
hit that the Red Sox had made so far in the game.
If it had been properly played and taken on the
bound, it could have been held to a single. But
Becker made a mistake in thinking that he could
make a fly catch. The ball struck the ground in
front of him, bounded over his head and rolled
to the further corner of the field. Before it could
be recovered, Walters had made the circuit of the
bases, following Loomis over the plate, and the
Red Sox were in the lead by two runs to one.</p>

<p>The Boston rooters started their marching song
of “Tessie,” while the New Yorkers sat glum and
silent.</p>

<p>Joe tightened up and struck out the two following
batters in jig time, but it looked as though
the mischief had been done.</p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you, Joe,” counseled
McRae, as he came in to the bench. “You’re
pitching like a Gatling gun. That’s the first hit
they’ve got off you in six innings and it ought to
have been a single only. We’ll beat ’em yet.”</p>

<p>“Sure we will,” answered Joe, cheerfully.
“We’ve only begun to fight.”</p>

<p>At the beginning of the “lucky seventh,” the
crowd rose and stretched in the fond hope that it
would bring the necessary luck for their favorites.</p>

<p>The omen might have worked, had it not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
for a dazzling bit of play on the part of the Bostons.</p>

<p>Their own half had been fruitless. Joe was
pitching now like a man inspired, and his bewildering
curves and slants had made the Boston sluggers
look like “bushers.”</p>

<p>In the Giants’ half, Joe was the first man up
and he laced out a hot liner between second and
short that carried him easily to first. Mylert hit
to short and Joe was forced at second, though
Berry relayed the ball to Hobbs too late for a
double play. A wild pitch, the only one of the
game, advanced Mylert a base. Burkett received
a pass. Now there was a man on first, another on
second, and rousing cheers came from the stands.
There was only one man out, Fraser was evidently
getting wild, and it looked as though New York
might score.</p>

<p>The Boston infield moved in for a double play.
And it looked for a moment as though they would
make it. Larry hit to short, and a groan went up.
But the hit was so sharp that Stock could not
handle it cleanly, and, though he succeeded in getting
Burkett at second Larry reached first safely
while Mylert raced to third.</p>

<p>It was a time for desperate measures, and
McRae gave the signal for a double steal. The
moment Fraser wound up, Larry started for second,
not with a design of reaching it, but hoping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to draw a throw from the catcher, under cover of
which Mylert might scamper home from third.
If he could touch the plate before Larry was put
out, the run would count and the score be tied.</p>

<p>Thompson threw like a shot to Berry at second.
But instead of chasing Larry, who had
stopped midway between first and second, he kept
threatening to throw to third and catch Mylert,
who was taking as big a lead toward home as he
dared. After playing hide and seek for a moment,
Berry thought he saw a chance to nip Mylert and
threw to Girdner at third. But the ball touched
the tips of his fingers and got past him, and Mylert
started for home.</p>

<p>A howl of exultation went up from the throng.
Then it died away as suddenly as it had risen.</p>

<p>Girdner, chasing the ball, slipped as he went to
pick it up. Lying on the grass, he made a desperate
throw in the direction of the plate. It
went high, but Thompson made a tremendous
jump, pulled it down and clapped it on Mylert
just as he slid into the rubber.</p>

<p>“Out,” yelled the umpire.</p>

<p>It was as classy a play as any of the spectators
had ever seen, and even the New Yorkers, sore as
they were at losing the run, joined generously in
the applause that greeted it.</p>

<p>“That fellow Girdner must have a rabbit’s foot
about him somewhere,” remarked Robson to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
McRae with a twisted smile. “He couldn’t do
that thing again in a thousand years.”</p>

<p>“A few more things like that and the crowd
will die of heart disease or nervous prostration,”
answered McRae. “But they can’t have all the
breaks. Just watch. Our turn will be coming
next.”</p>

<p>But nothing happened in the eighth to change
the score, and the ninth opened with the Red Sox
still in the lead.</p>

<p>That the Red Sox would not score again was
as nearly certain as anything can be in baseball.
Joe, as cool as an icicle, was going at top speed.
They simply could not touch his offerings.</p>

<p>But as the visitors went back in one, two, three
order, they consoled themselves with the thought
that they did not have to do any more scoring.
They were already ahead, and if Fraser could hold
their opponents down for one more inning, the
game was theirs.</p>

<p>But Fraser had about reached his limit. He
could not stand the gaff as sturdily as Joe. With
the exception of that one wild spell, he had
pitched superbly, but the terrific strain was beginning
to tell.</p>

<p>His first two pitches went as balls, and McRae,
whose eagle eyes saw signs of wavering, signaled
Becker, who was at the bat, to “wait him out.”</p>

<p>The advice proved good, and Becker trotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
down to first where he immediately began to
dance about and yell, hoping to draw a throw
which in the pitcher’s nervous condition might go
wild.</p>

<p>The Red Sox players shouted encouragement
to their pitcher, and the catcher walked down to
the box on the pretense of advice but really to
give him time to recover himself.</p>

<p>No doubt this helped, for Fraser braced up and
made Iredell put up a towering foul, which
Thompson caught after a long run.</p>

<p>Joe came next and cracked out a pretty single
between short and second. Becker tried to make
third on it, but a magnificent throw by Walters
nipped him at the bag. But in the mix-up, Joe, by
daring running, got to second.</p>

<p>With two out, a long hit would tie the game,
anyway, and carry it into extra innings.</p>

<p>Fraser seemed to waver again and gave Mylert
his base on balls. Then big Burkett, the head
of the batting order, strode to the plate.</p>

<p>Amid frantic adjurations from the crowd to
“kill the ball,” he caught the second one pitched
and sent a screaming liner far out toward the right
field wall.</p>

<p>Cooper, the fleet Red Sox right fielder, had
started for it at the crack of the bat. On, on he
went, running like a deer.</p>

<p>Thirty-five thousand people were on their feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
yelling like maniacs, while Joe, Mylert and Burkett
raced round the bases.</p>

<p>Ball and man reached the wall at the same instant.
The gallant player leaped high in the air.
But the ball just touched the tips of his fingers
and rolled away, while Joe and Mylert dented the
rubber, Burkett halting when he reached second.</p>

<p>Then the crowd went crazy.</p>

<p>The game was over. It had been a battle royal,
but the Giants had vanquished the Red Sox, and
had taken their first stride toward the championship
of the world.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE TABLES TURNED</small></h2>


<p>Baseball Joe waited just long enough to wave
his cap at the box in which his party sat, and then
raced with his companions to the clubhouse before
the crowd that was rushing down over the
field should overwhelm them.</p>

<p>Mabel turned towards Mrs. Matson, who had
been watching the game with the most intense interest
and yet with a sense of complete bewilderment.
The intricacies of the game were new to
her, but she knew that her boy had won, and at
the applause showered upon him her fond heart
swelled with motherly pride.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that son of yours now?”
Mabel asked gaily. “Didn’t I tell you he was
going to win?”</p>

<p>“It was j-just wonderful,” replied Mrs. Matson,
reaching for her handkerchief to stay the happy
tears that had not been far from her eyes all
through the game.</p>

<p>Mr. Matson had renewed his youth, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
eyes were shining like a boy’s. Clara clapped her
hands and laughed almost hysterically.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!” she cried. “And he’s my
brother!”</p>

<p>Mabel laughed and gave her a little affectionate
pat.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder that you’re proud of him,” she
said. Joe would have been glad to hear the slight
tremble in her voice.</p>

<p>In the clubhouse there was, of course, a mighty
celebration. A lead of one game in such a series
as that promised to be was, as “Robbie” exultantly
said, “not to be sneezed at.” Now they would
have to win only three more to be sure of the flag,
while the Red Sox needed to take four.</p>

<p>And yet, despite the victory, there was no undue
boasting or elation. They had not won by any
such margin as to justify too rosy a view of the
future. The Red Sox had fought for the game
tooth and nail, and at various stages a hair would
have turned the balance one way or the other.
The Bostons were an enemy to be dreaded, and a
profound respect for their opponents had been implanted
in the Giants’ breasts.</p>

<p>Besides, McRae knew that he had “played his
ace” in putting Joe into the box. He had no
pitcher of equal rank to bring out on the morrow,
while at least two of the Red Sox boxmen were
quite as high as Fraser in quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“You did splendidly to-day, Matson,” said
McRae to Joe, clapping him jovially on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we won,” responded Joe. “But that
Fraser is no slouch when it comes to putting them
over.”</p>

<p>“He’s a crackerjack,” the manager admitted.
“But you topped him all the way through. We
raked him for seven hits, though he kept them
pretty well scattered. But they only got to you
for three, and one of them was a scratch. And he
was wobbly twice, while you only gave one pass.”</p>

<p>“That crack of Burkett’s was a dandy,” observed
Joe. “And it came just in the nick of
time.”</p>

<p>“It was a lulu,” chuckled McRae. “My heart
was in my mouth when I saw Cooper making for
it. Mighty few hits get away from that bird, but
it was just a bit too high for him.”</p>

<p>Both teams were to leave for Boston that night.
A special train made up entirely of Pullman cars
had been prepared to carry them, together with
hundreds of enthusiasts who had planned to go
with them back and forth and see each game of
the Series. They would reach the city a little
after midnight, and in order that the athletes might
not be disturbed, they would be shunted into a remote
part of the railroad yards where they could
slumber peacefully until morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>But several hours were to elapse before the
train started. Joe hurried into his street clothes,
and, accompanied by Jim Barclay, was whirled
away in a taxicab to the Marlborough, where they
had arranged to have a jolly dinner with his family
and the Varleys.</p>

<p>The baseball players found everything ready
for them, and the welcome that greeted them
warmed their hearts.</p>

<p>“What a pity that we haven’t a band here ready
to strike up: ‘Hail the conquering heroes come,’”
said Mabel, mischievously.</p>

<p>“‘Hero,’ you mean,” corrected Jim. “I’m shining
with only reflected glory. Here’s the real
hero of the piece,” indicating Joe. “I’m only one
of the Roman populace.”</p>

<p>“And who’s the villain?” smiled Mr. Matson.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fraser was the villain,” responded Jim.
“But Joe foiled him just as he was about to carry
away the che-ild.”</p>

<p>Barclay had not yet met Joe’s family, but now
Joe introduced him to his parents and Clara.
They greeted him cordially, and Clara’s eyes fell
before the admiration that leaped into Jim’s merry
blue ones.</p>

<p>It is barely possible that that young lady had
thought more than once of what Joe had said of
Barclay in the letter that had enclosed the thousand
dollar bill. And now as she studied him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
shyly from time to time while he chatted away
gaily, she had no difficulty in understanding why
Joe had spoken so enthusiastically of his friend.
And she was not sorry that Mabel had arranged
that she and Jim should sit next each other at the
table.</p>

<p>They were soon talking with freedom and animation.</p>

<p>“You ought to be awfully proud of that brother
of yours,” Jim declared.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” Clara exclaimed. “He’s the
dearest brother that ever lived.”</p>

<p>“He’s a prince,” assented Jim. “A finer fellow
never trod in shoe leather. I owe an awful lot to
him, Miss Matson. I was feeling as forlorn as
only a ‘rookie’ can feel when I broke into the big
league, but he took me up at once and we’ve been
like brothers ever since.”</p>

<p>“He’s often spoken of you in his letters home,”
replied Clara. “I’d tell you what he said of you,
only it would make you too conceited.”</p>

<p>“And he’s raved to me about that sister of his,”
said Jim. “He’s done more than that. He’s
shown me your picture. I’ve been tempted more
than once to steal it from him.”</p>

<p>“What a desperate criminal,” laughed Clara,
her cheeks growing pink.</p>

<p>“I think any jury would justify me if they once
saw the picture,” replied Jim, gallantly, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
they certainly would if they caught sight of the
original.”</p>

<p>From this it can be seen that these young folks
were fast becoming very friendly.</p>

<p>“It has been the dream of my life to see New
York and Boston,” observed Clara.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said Jim, eagerly. “I know both
of them like a book. You must let me show you
around.”</p>

<p>“That’s very nice of you,” said Clara, demurely.
“But I suppose Joe will want&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” said Jim. “But Joe will be so
busy you know with the games. He’ll be under
a big strain, while I’ll probably have plenty of
time. I’m only a sort of fifth wheel to the coach,
while Joe’s the whole thing. And then, too, Joe’s
already got Mabel, and it isn’t fair that he should
have two lovely girls while I’m left out in the
cold. You really must take pity on me.”</p>

<p>Few girls would have been so hard-hearted as
to let such a handsome young fellow as Jim die
of grief, and Clara had no intention of hastening
his demise by excessive cruelty on her part. So
she assented, though with the proper degree of
maidenly hesitation, and they began merrily to
map out plans for the coming week.</p>

<p>Joe, seated with Mabel on one side and his
mother on the other, had also been enjoying himself
hugely through the dinner, while Reggie and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Mr. Matson found plenty to talk about in discussing
the events of the day. The time passed all
too swiftly and before they knew it they had to
begin preparations for the journey.</p>

<p>“Let’s look at the weather probabilities for to-morrow,”
said Joe, buying an evening paper at
the newsstand as they passed through the Grand
Central Terminal.</p>

<p>“Um&mdash;cloudy and unsettled,” he read.</p>

<p>“That means that we’ll have to get busy and
win in the first five innings before the rain comes,”
laughed Jim.</p>

<p>“It ought to be a good day to pitch Markwith,”
returned Joe. “With a cloudy day and that blinding
speed of his they won’t be able to see the ball.”</p>

<p>The two young athletes saw their party to their
car, and after a few moments of pleasant chat
bade them good-night and repaired to the Pullmans
that had been reserved for the Giant team.</p>

<p>All were in a most jovial mood and filled with
highest hopes for the morrow. Joke and banter
flew back and forth, until the watchful McRae asserted
the claims of discipline and sent them all to
their berths.</p>

<p>The next morning when they drew the curtains,
they found that the weather man’s prognostications
had been correct. Dull, leaden-colored
clouds chased each other across the sky and a
bleak wind came from the east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Looks like soggy weather, sure enough,”
commented Jim, as he met Joe in the lavatory.</p>

<p>“It certainly does,” assented Joe. “Hope it
holds off till after the game. It may cut down the
attendance.”</p>

<p>“No danger of that unless it rains cats and
dogs,” rejoined Jim. “Boston is the best baseball
city in the country, and it’ll take more than a
few clouds or even a drizzle to keep the crowds
away.”</p>

<p>They breakfasted in the dining car, and then
Joe’s party adjourned to the hotel where rooms
had been reserved. There was not much time for
sight seeing, but they all had a pleasant little stroll
on the Common and in the wonderful Botanical
Gardens, before their duties called the young men
away to the baseball grounds.</p>

<p>The weather still continued threatening, but as
Jim had prophesied, this did not affect the attendance.
Boston was as wild over the Series as New
York, and long before noon Commonwealth Avenue
and Gaffney Street were packed with the oncoming
throngs. By the time the game started the
enormous Braves Field was packed to its utmost
capacity.</p>

<p>Personally, McRae welcomed the overcast sky.
It was a pitcher’s day, a day that called for speed,
and speed as everybody knew was Markwith’s
“long suit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Smoke ’em over, Red,” was McRae’s admonition,
when he told Markwith he was slated to
pitch. “If we can only put this game on the right
side of the ledger, the world’s flag is as good as
won. Give us a lead of two games and it will take
the spine out of those birds. They’ll never catch
up.”</p>

<p>“I get you, Mac,” grinned the pitcher. “I’ll
zip ’em over so fast they’ll have to use glasses to
see ’em.”</p>

<p>For four innings it looked as though his prophecy
would be fulfilled. His companions played
like fiends behind him, and although the Bostons
got to him for three bingles, they were scattered
ones, and not a man got as far as third base.</p>

<p>“Looks as though Red had their goat, John,”
Robson remarked to McRae.</p>

<p>“He’s doing fine,” McRae returned, “and our
boys seem to be getting to Banks pretty freely.”</p>

<p>The Giants had, in fact, got a pretty good line
on Banks, the port flinger of the Red Sox, and had
accumulated three runs, which, with Markwith
going as he was, seemed a very comfortable lead.</p>

<p>But the glorious uncertainty of the national
game was demonstrated in the next inning. The
Giants had been disposed of in their half with a
goose egg, and the Red Sox came in to bat.</p>

<p>The first man up was given a base on balls. The
next hit a sharp bounder to Denton, who ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
have made an easy out either at first or second,
but he juggled the ball and both men were safe.</p>

<p>The error seemed to unnerve Markwith, and
he gave another pass, filling the bases.</p>

<p>“Get to him, boys!” screamed the Boston
coacher on the side lines near first base. “He’s
got nothing on the ball but his glove and a
prayer.”</p>

<p>Walters, the slugging center fielder, caught the
second ball pitched right on the seam and sent it
on a line between left and center for the cleanest
of home runs, clearing the bases and denting the
rubber himself for the fourth run. In jig time,
the Red Sox had wiped out the Giants’ advantage
and taken the lead.</p>

<p>The crowd went wild and the “Tessie” song
swelled up from the stands.</p>

<p>McRae, with his brow like a thunder cloud,
beckoned Red from the box and called in Jim, who,
as a matter of precaution but with little idea of
being called upon, had been warming up in a corner
of the grounds.</p>

<p>“It’s up to you, Barclay,” he said as he handed
him the ball. “Let’s see now what stuff you’re
made of.”</p>

<p>Joe gave Jim an encouraging pat on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Steady does it, old man,” he said. “They’re
only one run ahead and the bases are empty. Hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
them down and our boys will hand you enough
runs to win out.”</p>

<p>It was a trying position for a young and comparatively
new pitcher, but Jim was a “comer”
and had already proved in other games that he
had both skill and nerve.</p>

<p>“Knock this one out of the box, too,” came from
the stands.</p>

<p>“Sew up the game right now!”</p>

<p>“Eat him up!”</p>

<p>“He’ll be easy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you Red Sox!”</p>

<p>Jim wound up and shot one over for a strike.</p>

<p>“Easy, is he?” came back from the Giant supporters.
“Just watch that boy’s smoke.”</p>

<p>Another strike followed, and the stands sobered
down a little.</p>

<p>“You’re out,” called the umpire, as a third
strike split the plate.</p>

<p>Shouts of delight and encouragement came from
the Giants’ bench, and McRae’s face lightened
somewhat.</p>

<p>The next man went out on a high foul, and the
inning ended when Stock popped an easy fly to the
box.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, old man!” came from his mates,
as Jim walked in from the mound.</p>

<p>“Knock out some runs now, you fellows,” admonished
McRae. “Barclay can’t do it all. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
do it in a hurry, too. I don’t like the way those
clouds are coming up.”</p>

<p>The sky was blackening rapidly, and the wind,
coming from the east in strong gusts, told that a
storm was on the way.</p>

<p>The Giants knew the need of haste, and they
went at their work fiercely. Larry started proceedings
with a rattling two bagger. Denton
sacrificed him to third. Willis lined out a single,
bringing in Larry and reaching second himself a
moment later on a passed ball. Becker sent one
to right that scored Willis and netted two bags for
himself. Iredell went out on an infield catch, but
Mylert came to the rescue with a sizzling hit that
brought Becker to the plate amid frantic shouts
from the New York rooters.</p>

<p>Three runs had been scored and New York was
again in the lead by six to four. Two men were
out. But now rain began to fall, although at first
it was only a drizzle, and McRae, frenzied with
anxiety, ordered Burkett to strike out.</p>

<p>Now, of course, it was the Bostons’ cue to delay
the game. If they could prevent the sixth inning
from being fully played out before the rain stopped
proceedings, the score would revert to what it
was at the end of the fifth inning and Boston would
be declared the winner.</p>

<p>They came in slowly from the field, stopping
frequently to talk to each other. Then when at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
last they were at their bench, the first batter took
unusual pains in selecting his bat. And all the
time the rain was falling more heavily.</p>

<p>McRae rushed at the umpire.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see what they’re doing?” he demanded.
“Make them play ball.”</p>

<p>The umpire turned sternly to the batter.</p>

<p>“Hurry up there,” he commanded. “None of
your monkey tricks or I’ll forfeit the game to the
New Yorks.”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, the batter sauntered as slowly
as he dared to the plate.</p>

<p>Jim put over a strike.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t a strike,” argued the Boston captain.
“It didn’t come within six inches of the
plate.”</p>

<p>“No argument,” snapped the umpire, who saw
through the tactics. “Go ahead there,” he called
to Jim.</p>

<p>Jim put over two more. The batter did not
even offer at them. He had figured that with an
occasional ball switched in it would take more
time to put him out on strikes than if he gave a
fielder’s chance. But there were no balls and he
was declared out.</p>

<p>The second man crawled like a snail to the plate.
It was pouring now and the bleachers were black
with umbrellas. The Giants were fairly dancing
up and down with impatience and apprehension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim pitched like lightning, not waiting to wind
up. But before he could dispose of the batsmen,
<a href="#image03">the heavens opened and the rain came down in
torrents</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_105">THE HEAVENS OPENED AND THE RAIN CAME DOWN IN TORRENTS.</a></div>

<p>Play was impossible. The umpire called the
game and everybody scurried for shelter.</p>

<p>Old Jupiter Pluvius had taken a hand in the
game.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>A GALLANT EFFORT</small></h2>


<p>It is needless to paint the exasperation on the
faces of McRae and Robson and the rest of the
Giant team, as they saw victory taken from them
just as they were tightening their grip upon it.</p>

<p>“Talk about luck,” growled McRae. “Those
fellows have got hogsheads of it.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t that rain have held off for ten
minutes more?” groaned the rotund Robson.</p>

<p>“It may let up even yet enough to let the game
go on,” remarked Larry, though without much
conviction.</p>

<p>“Such a chance,” grunted Willis. “Why, you
could take a swim at second base already.”</p>

<p>There was, indeed, little hope of resuming the
game, although in accordance with the rules, if the
rain ceased in half an hour and the grounds were
in condition for play, the umpires could call the
teams back to the field. But the rain was blinding,
and to wait around any longer was only a matter
of form.</p>

<p>Joe and Jim had worked their way through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
crowds to the box in which their party sat. In the
neat, gray, traveling uniforms that set their athletic
figures off to perfection, the girls thought
they looked handsomer than ever.</p>

<p>All gave them a hearty welcome and gladly
made room for them. It was, of course, only by a
coincidence that Joe found himself next to Mabel
while Jim sat close to Clara.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad your side won, Joe,” said motherly
Mrs. Matson, beaming lovingly on her son
and heir.</p>

<p>“But we didn’t, Momsey,” Joe laughed a little
ruefully.</p>

<p>“Why, I kept count of the runs,” said his mother
in surprise, “and your side made six while the others
had only four.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, but our last three don’t count,”
explained Joe. “If we could only have finished
out this last inning, we’d have won. But it wasn’t
finished, and so the score went back to the end of
the fifth inning when the Bostons were ahead four
to three.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s a shame!” exclaimed his mother,
with as near an approach to indignation as her
kindly nature was capable of feeling.</p>

<p>“Those old Bostons were just horrid to try to
delay the game that way,” declared Clara.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a bit sportsmanlike,” declared Mabel,
warmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe favored Jim with a solemn wink. Both
knew that the Giants would have done precisely
the same thing if positions had been reversed. It
was a legitimate enough part of the game if one
could “get away with it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Joe, keeping his face straight.
“It didn’t seem exactly the thing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder Mr. McRae was angry,” said
Mabel. “I’m sure he wouldn’t have done a thing
like that.”</p>

<p>Joe had a sudden choking fit.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “there’s no use crying over
spilt milk. We ought to have made those runs
earlier in the game, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I felt so sorry for poor Mr. Markwith,” said
Mrs. Matson. “It must have been very mortifying
to have to give up before so many people.”</p>

<p>“Poor Red,” said Joe. “It was too bad, especially
when he got away to such a splendid start.
But every pitcher has to take his medicine some
time. Pitchers are very much like race horses.
One day no one can beat them and another day
any one can beat them.”</p>

<p>“I think you did splendidly, Mr. Barclay,” said
Clara, shyly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t have much to do,” said Jim. “Just
the same,” he added, dropping his voice a trifle,
“I’d rather hear you say that than any one else
I know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The flush that made Clara look like a wild
rose deepened in her cheeks not only from the
words but the quick look that accompanied
them.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it might clear up yet?” she
asked, changing the subject.</p>

<p>Jim followed her gaze reluctantly. He had
something better to look at than the weather.</p>

<p>“The clouds do seem to be breaking away a little,”
he assented. “But the base paths are a sea
of mud, and the outfield is a perfect quagmire.
There go the umpires now to look at it.”</p>

<p>Those dignitaries (there were four of them that
officiated at each game, one behind the plate, one
at the bases and the two others at the foul lines in
right and left field, respectively) were, as a matter
of fact, solemnly stalking out on the field.</p>

<p>From the stands went up a thunderous roar:
“Call the game! Call the game!”</p>

<p>The Boston rooters were taking no chances and
were perfectly willing to go without further baseball
that afternoon, now that their favorites had
the game won.</p>

<p>But their exhortations were unnecessary. Even
McRae, clinging desperately to the last chance,
could not in justice to his common sense urge that
play should be continued. It was clearly impossible,
and would have degenerated into a farce
that would have risked the limbs of his athletes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to say nothing of the harm it would work to the
game.</p>

<p>So there was no protest when the game was
formally and finally declared off, and the disgruntled
New Yorks gathered up their bats and strode
from the field.</p>

<p>“Never mind, boys,” comforted McRae. “We
can beat the Red Sox but we can’t beat them and
the rain together. Better luck next time.”</p>

<p>“That listens good,” grumbled “Robbie,” who
refused to be consoled. “But now we’ve lost the
jump on them and it’s all to be done over again.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re no worse off than they are, anyway,”
returned the Giant manager.</p>

<p>“If we could only pitch Matson every day, the
Series would be a cinch,” mused Robson.</p>

<p>“A copper-riveted cinch,” agreed McRae. “But
I was mightily encouraged at the way young Barclay
mowed them down. The ball didn’t look any
bigger than a pea as it came over the plate.”</p>

<p>“He certainly had lots of stuff on the ball,” admitted
Robson. “I wonder if he can stand the gaff
for a full game.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether he’s seasoned enough
for that yet,” said McRae, thoughtfully. “But it’ll
stand a lot of thinking about. We’ll see first
though how Hughson’s feeling when we get back
to New York.”</p>

<p>The return journey to New York was not by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
any means so joyful as the trip out had been. Still,
there was no discouragement in the Giants’ camp.
They had played good ball and with the lead they
had and the way Jim was pitching would probably
have won if it had not been for the rain. And on
the theory that the good and bad luck of the game
usually struck an average, they felt that they were
due to have the break in their favor the next time.</p>

<p>As for Joe and Jim, although, of course, they
shared the chagrin of their mates, their cloud had
plenty of silver lining. They had played their own
parts well so far in the Series, and had no painful
recollections to grow moody about. And then,
too, were they not in the company of the two girls
whom they devoutly believed to be the most charming
in the world?</p>

<p>They made the most of that company in the
quiet Sunday that followed. Mr. and Mrs. Matson
smilingly declined Reggie’s cordial invitation,
on the ground that they were feeling the need of
rest after the excitement. The young people
bundled into the car and they had a delightful ride
through the woods of Westchester, whose trees
were putting on their autumn tints of scarlet and
russet and gold. A supper at the Claremont put
the finish to a day in which the blind god with his
bow and arrows had been extremely busy, and the
drive home through the twilight was something
none of them ever forgot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, Joe, scanning the paper, gave
a delighted exclamation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jim, disturbed in
a pleasing reverie that had nothing to do with
baseball.</p>

<p>“Matter enough,” returned Joe, handing him
the paper. “Hughson’s going to pitch. McRae
must have fixed it up with him yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Gallant old scout!” cried Jim, his eyes kindling.
“I was sure he’d get into the scrap somewhere.
The only way you could keep that old
war horse out of the World Series would be to
hit him with an axe!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>MORE HARD LUCK</small></h2>


<p>“Won’t this make Boston feel sore!” Baseball
Joe exulted.</p>

<p>“You bet it will,” chuckled Jim. “That’s the
one thing they were banking on more than anything
else. With Hughson out, they thought we
didn’t have a chance.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get through breakfast in a hurry and run
up and see the old boy,” cried Joe.</p>

<p>Jim needed no urging and they were soon in a
taxicab and on their way to Hughson’s home.</p>

<p>They were met at the door by Mrs. Hughson,
who greeted them with a pleasant smile and ushered
them into the living room, where they found
the great pitcher stretched out at his ease and running
over the columns of the morning paper.</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet when he saw who his visitors
were, and there was a hearty interchange of
handshakes.</p>

<p>“So Richard is himself again,” beamed Joe.</p>

<p>“Best news we’ve had in a dog’s age,” added
Jim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I guess the old salary wing is on the job
again,” laughed Hughson.</p>

<p>“How’s it feeling?” asked Joe, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Fine as silk,” Hughson responded. “I’ve been
trying it out gradually, and I don’t see but what I
can put them over as well as ever I did. It hurts
me a little on the high, fast ones, but everything
else I’ve got in stock seems to go as well as I could
ask.”</p>

<p>“What does the doctor say about your pitching?”
asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s dead set against it,” was the answer.
“Tells me it isn’t well yet by any means,
and that it may go back on me any minute. But
you know how those doctors are. They always
want to make a sure thing of it. But McRae and
I have been talking it over, and we’ve concluded
that in the present condition of things it might be
well to take a chance.”</p>

<p>“That head of yours is all right, anyway, you
old fox,” laughed Joe. “You’ve always pitched
with that as much as with your arm. You’ll outguess
those fellows, even if you have to favor your
arm a little.”</p>

<p>“We’ll hope so, anyway,” was the reply. “That
was hard luck the boys had in Boston on Saturday,
wasn’t it? Pity we couldn’t have had it played
here that day. It didn’t rain a drop in New
York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“We were surely up against it,” replied Joe.
“But to-day’s another day and we’ll hope it tells a
different story.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” grinned Hughson, “an old friend
of yours was up here yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked Joe. “Who was it?”</p>

<p>“‘Bugs’ Hartley.”</p>

<p>The two young men gave vent to an exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p>“He’s a great friend of mine,” said Joe, dryly.
“He met me on the street the other night and
showed me that I was as popular with him as a
rattlesnake at a picnic party.”</p>

<p>“He certainly is sore at you,” Hughson laughed.
“He started in to pan you but I shut him up in a
hurry. I told him that you’d always done everything
you could to help him, and I hinted to him
that we knew pretty well who drugged your coffee
that day you pitched against the Phillies. He
swore, of course, that he didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“I know that he did,” Joe replied. “But still
I’ve never felt so sore against poor old Bugs as
I would have felt against any one else who did
such a thing, because I knew that he was a little
queer in the head. Even now I’d gladly do him a
favor if I could. What did he come here for?”</p>

<p>“He wanted to get on to Boston but didn’t have
the price,” answered Hughson. “He thought that
if he could see Rawlings he might get a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
with the Braves for next season. And he might,
at that. You know what Rawlings has done with
a lot of cast-offs from other teams, and if he could
keep Bugs from kicking over the traces he might
get something out of him next year. You know as
well as I do what Bugs can do in the pitching line
if he’ll only brace up and cut out drink. So I
coughed up enough to send him on and I hope
he’ll get another chance.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” rejoined Joe, heartily. “There
are mighty few teams that can beat him when he’s
right.”</p>

<p>“But keep your eyes open, Joe, just the same,”
counseled Hughson. “He’s holding a grudge
against you in that old twisted brain of his, and
you’d be as safe with him as if you were on a battlefield.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s done his worst already,” Joe
laughed carelessly.</p>

<p>They talked a few minutes longer, and then, as
the rubber came in to give Hughson’s arm its daily
massage, they took their way downtown.</p>

<p>The whole city was alive with excitement at the
news that the famous standby of the Giants was to
be in the box that afternoon. Yet mingled with
this was an under current of anxiety. Was he in
shape to pitch? Would that mighty arm of his
hold out, so soon after his injury?</p>

<p>If wild and long-continued cheering could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
won the game, it would have been won right at
the start when Hughson came out on the field a little
while before the gong sounded.</p>

<p>It was a tribute of which any man might have
been proud. For more than a dozen years he had
been the mainstay of the team. His record had
never been approached in baseball history.</p>

<p>Year in and year out he had pitched his team
to victory. Several times they had won the pennant
of the National League, and even when they
failed they had always been up among the contenders.
And more than to any single man, this had
been due to Hughson’s stout heart and mighty
arm.</p>

<p>And the affection showered upon him was due
not only to his prowess as a twirler, but to his
character as a man. He was a credit to the game.
The fines and discipline, so necessary in the case
of many brilliant players, had never been visited
upon him. He had steered clear of dissipation in
any form. He was sportsmanlike and generous.
Players on opposing teams liked him, the umpires
respected him, his mates idolized him, and the
great baseball public hailed him with acclamations
whenever he appeared on the field.</p>

<p>And to-day the applause was heartier than ever
because of the importance of the game and also in
recognition of his gameness in coming to the help
of his team so soon after a serious accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re all with you, Hughson,” smiled
McRae, as the bronzed pitcher lifted his cap in
response to the cheers that rose from every quarter
of the field.</p>

<p>“They seem to be, John,” replied Hughson.
“Let’s hope they won’t be disappointed.”</p>

<p>As the game went on, it seemed as though the
hopes of the spectators were to be gratified.</p>

<p>The veteran pitched superbly for seven innings.
His twirling was up to the standard of his best
games. He mowed the opposing batsman down
one after the other, and as inning after inning
passed with only two scratch hits as the Bostons’
total, it began to look as though it would be a shutout
for the visitors.</p>

<p>“They’ve got holes in their bats,” cried McRae,
gleefully, as he brought his hand down on Robson’s
knee with a thump.</p>

<p>“It sure looks like it!” ejaculated Robbie. “But
for the love of Mike, John, go easy. That ham of
yours weighs a hundred pounds.”</p>

<p>But the Boston pitcher, stirred up by the fact
that he was pitted against the great Hughson,
was also “going great guns.” Larry and Burkett
had been the only Giants so far to solve his delivery.
Each had hammered out a brace of hits,
but their comrades had been unable to bring them
in from the bags on which they were roosting.</p>

<p>“Get after him, boys,” raged McRae. “You’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hitting like a bunch from the old ladies’ home.
Split the game wide open.”</p>

<p>They promised vehemently to knock the cover
off the ball, but the Red Sox pitcher, Landers, was
not a party to the bargain and he obstinately refused
to “crack.”</p>

<p>In the first half of the eighth, Cooper, of the
Bostons, knocked up an infield fly that either
Larry or Denton could have got easily. But they
collided in running for it and the ball fell to the
ground and rolled out toward center. Iredell, who
was backing up the play, retrieved it, but in the
mix-up, Cooper, by fast running, reached second.</p>

<p>Though both men had been shaken up by the
collision they were not seriously injured, and after
a few minutes play was resumed.</p>

<p>But in the strained condition of the players’
nerves, the accident had to some degree unstrung
them. So that when Berry chopped an easy roller
to Denton that the latter ordinarily would have
“eaten up,” he juggled it for a moment. Then, in
his haste to make the put-out at first, he threw
wild and the ball went over Burkett’s head. Before
he could get it back, Cooper had scored and
Berry was on third.</p>

<p>The Boston rooters howled like wild men, and
their hats went sailing into the air.</p>

<p>Hughson, cool as an iceberg, brought his fadeaway
into play and whiffed the next man up. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Hobbs rolled one to the left of the box. Hughson
made a great reach for it and got it, though
he slipped and fell as he did so. He snapped the
ball, however, to Mylert, nipping Berry at the
plate.</p>

<p>Mylert returned the ball to Hughson who took
his position in the box and began to wind up. But
almost instantly his hand dropped to his side.</p>

<p>He tried again but fruitlessly.</p>

<p>McRae ran out to him in consternation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>FLEMING TURNS UP AGAIN</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter, Hughson?” McRae cried.</p>

<p>“The old arm won’t work,” replied the pitcher.
“Guess I hurt it in the same old place when I fell.”</p>

<p>His fellow players crowded around him, and
the umpire, who had called time, came up to ascertain
the damage.</p>

<p>The club doctor also ran out from his seat in
the stands near the press box and made a hurried
examination.</p>

<p>“You’ve strained those ligaments again,” he
remarked, “and as far as I can tell now one of
them is broken. I told you that they weren’t
healed enough for you to pitch.”</p>

<p>McRae groaned in sympathy with Hughson and
in dismay for himself and his team. He had been
congratulating himself that with Hughson in the
fine form he had showed that afternoon the
world’s pennant was as good as won.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, old man,” he said to Hughson.
“You never pitched better. You were just burning
them over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m fearfully sorry,” Hughson answered. “I
did want to be in the thick of the fight with the rest
of the boys. But I guess all I can do from now
on is to root for them.”</p>

<p>He took off his glove and walked over to the
bench, amid a chorus of commiserating shouts
from the stands.</p>

<p>McRae beckoned to Joe.</p>

<p>“Jump in, Joe,” he directed briefly, “and hold
them down. They’ve only got one run. I’m depending
on you to see that they don’t get any
more.”</p>

<p>Joe went into the box and tossed two or three
to Mylert to get the range of the plate. He had a
greeting from the fans that warmed the cockles
of his heart.</p>

<p>There were two men out and Hobbs was dancing
around first. Joe saw out of the corner of his
eye that he was taking too big a lead, and snapped
the ball like a bullet to Burkett. Hobbs tried desperately
to get back but was nipped by a foot.</p>

<p>Joe had finished putting out the side without
pitching a ball.</p>

<p>“Some speed that,” came from the stands.</p>

<p>“I guess Matson’s slow.”</p>

<p>“We don’t have to pitch to beat you fellows,”
piped a fan and the crowd roared.</p>

<p>But nothing could hide the fact that the Red
Sox were ahead. McRae brought all his resources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
into play and sent two pinch hitters to the plate.
But though one of them, Browning, knocked out
a corking three-bagger, the inning ended without
results.</p>

<p>In the ninth, Joe had no trouble in disposing of
the men who faced him. His slants and cross fire
had them “buffaloed.” One went out on a foul,
another was an easy victim at first, and he put on
the finishing touch by striking the third man out.</p>

<p>McRae tore round among his men like an elephant
on a rampage as they came in for their half
of the ninth. They, however, needed no urging.
They were as wild to win as he was himself, and
they were almost frantic as they saw victory slipping
from them.</p>

<p>They did do something, but not enough. By
the time two men were out, there was a Giant on
first and another on second. Larry, the slugger
of the team, was at the bat. He picked out a fast
one and sent it hurtling on a line to left. It looked
like a sure hit, but Stock, the shortstop, leaped
high into the air and speared it with his gloved
hand, and the shout that had gone up from the
stands ended in a groan.</p>

<p>Three games of the Series had been played and
the Red Sox had won two of them!</p>

<p>It was a disgruntled band of athletes who went
under the shower in the Giant clubhouse that afternoon,
and when Joe and Jim joined their party at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the Marlborough in the early evening, the air of
jubilation they had worn on the day of the first
game was conspicuous by its absence.</p>

<p>“If you had that band here you were talking
about Friday, what do you suppose they would
play?” Joe asked of Mabel, after the first greetings
were over.</p>

<p>“They ought to play the ‘Dead March in
Saul,’” Jim volunteered.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” denied Mabel, cheerily.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There’s a better day coming and dinna’ ye doubt it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So just be canty wi’ thinking about it,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">she quoted, flashing a sunny smile at Joe that
made him feel more cheerful at once.</p>

<p>“It was too bad,” comforted Mrs. Matson.
“But, anyway, Joe, it wasn’t your fault,” she
added, beaming fondly on her son.</p>

<p>“Call it misfortune then, Momsey,” Joe smiled
back at her. “But it surely was that. We lost the
game, we lost it on our own grounds, we were
whitewashed, and worst of all Hughson is out for
the rest of the Series.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough for one day,” acquiesced Jim.</p>

<p>“Stop your grouching, you fellows,” admonished
Reggie. “You’ll have plenty of chances to
even things up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll fight all the harder,” agreed Joe.
“There isn’t a streak of yellow in the whole Giant
team. The boys will fight like wildcats and never
give up until the last man is out in the deciding
game. We’re looking for revenge to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And maybe revenge won’t be sweet!” chimed
in Jim.</p>

<p>“Who is going to pitch for your side to-morrow?”
asked Mr. Matson.</p>

<p>“McRae gave me a tip that I was to go in,”
Joe answered.</p>

<p>“Then we might as well count the game as good
as won,” declared Mabel.</p>

<p>“That certainly sounds good,” laughed Joe.
“But suppose I should be batted out of the box?
I wouldn’t dare show my diminished head among
you folks then.”</p>

<p>“We’re not worrying a bit about that,” put in
Clara, looking proudly at her idolized brother.</p>

<p>But the question was not to be settled on the
morrow, for when the day dawned in Boston the
rain was falling steadily, and the weather predictions
were that the rain would continue for the
greater part of the day.</p>

<p>For once, at least, the much maligned weather
prophet was right, for at noon the rain had not
abated, and, much to the disgust of the expectant
public, the game was declared off.</p>

<p>By the rules that had been made to cover such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
an event, the teams were to stay in Boston until
the first fair day should permit the game to be
played.</p>

<p>The different members of Joe’s party were
rather widely scattered, when the sun finally
peeped out in the course of the afternoon. Reggie
had taken his sister out to a country club where
he had a number of acquaintances. Mrs. Matson
and Clara were doing some shopping in the Boston
stores and Mr. Matson had gone out for a
stroll.</p>

<p>Joe and Jim had been downtown with the rest
of the team having a heart-to-heart talk with
McRae and Robson about the strategy to be
adopted in the forthcoming games.</p>

<p>By four o’clock the sun was shining gloriously
and the roads were beginning to dry out. Just
the day, Joe thought, to hire a runabout just big
enough for two and take Mabel out for a spin.</p>

<p>He conjectured that by the time he got the car
and reached the hotel Mabel would have returned
from her trip with Reggie and be ready for him.</p>

<p>“Come along, Jim, and help me to pick out the
car,” he said.</p>

<p>They went to a neighboring garage and selected
one which both agreed was a good one.</p>

<p>“Jump in, Jim,” said Joe, “and I’ll give you a
ride as far as the hotel.”</p>

<p>They were bowling rapidly along, when an automobile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
passed them, moving at a rate of speed
that was almost reckless. Joe saw that a man and
a woman were the only occupants.</p>

<p>He glanced carelessly at the man and was startled
when he saw that it was Beckworth Fleming.</p>

<p>But he was still more startled when his eyes
passed to the face of Fleming’s companion.</p>

<p>It was Mabel!</p>

<p>Jim, too, was staring as though he could not believe
his eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment Joe saw red and his blood boiled
with rage. He stopped the car and looked back.</p>

<p>Then his rage turned to alarm, for Mabel was
looking back and waving to him frantically, while
her companion seemed to be trying to draw her
back.</p>

<p>She was in peril!</p>

<p>Instantly, Joe turned his car and tore away in
pursuit.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>A CAD’S PUNISHMENT</small></h2>


<p>The hotel at which Mabel had been stopping
with the rest of the party was in a quiet residential
section not far from the suburbs, and Joe had
almost reached it at the time of the encounter.
There was little traffic here to interfere with the
chase, and in a few minutes pursuer and pursued
had cleared the outskirts and were in the open
country.</p>

<p>Joe caught a glimpse of Fleming looking back
and saw that the latter knew he was being followed,
a knowledge which was followed by a sudden
quickening in the pace of Fleming’s car.</p>

<p>It was, evidently, a powerful machine, and
despite Joe’s utmost efforts the gap between the
two cars kept constantly widening.</p>

<p>Joe had had a good deal of experience in handling
automobiles during his big league career, and
was a cool and skilful driver. But the utmost exertion
of his skill could avail little when he had an
inferior car pitted against one which greatly exceeded
it in horse power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>His heart was in his mouth as he saw how recklessly
Fleming was speeding. His car seemed to
be on two wheels only as he took the curves in the
road.</p>

<p>How Mabel came to be in that car was a question
that could wait for an answer till later. The
only thing that mattered now was that she was
there with a man she dreaded and despised, and
her frenzied waving told Joe that she was in mortal
fear and looked for him to help her.</p>

<p>Jim sat perfectly still without saying a word.
Nothing must distract Joe for a second from that
car and the view of the road ahead. He knew
what nerves of steel were back of the sinewy
hand that clutched the wheel. He had grasped
the meaning of the chase, and he shared with his
friend the determination that the cad in the car
ahead should pay dearly for this escapade.</p>

<p>Suddenly Joe gave an exultant cry.</p>

<p>As they turned a curve, he saw that a railroad
crossing lay ahead and that the gates were down,
while a long freight train was lumbering leisurely
by.</p>

<p>Fleming could not get past till the gates were
raised, and by that time Joe would be upon
him.</p>

<p>There was no cross road between him and the
track into which Fleming’s car could escape. His
enemy was trapped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ve got him, Joe!” exclaimed Jim, with
a thrill of exultation in his voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Joe gritted between his teeth. “I’ve got
him.”</p>

<p>And his tone would not have reassured Beckworth
Fleming.</p>

<p>Fleming’s car had halted and Fleming himself
had jumped out and run wildly to the gate, looking
up the track to see if the train was nearly by.
He saw at a glance that it would not have passed
before Joe would be upon him.</p>

<p>From the other side of the car, Mabel had
leaped as soon as it had stopped. She came running
back up the road, and Joe, who had stopped,
rushed forward and took her in his arms. She was
sobbing with fright and excitement, and Joe held
her close as he tried to soothe her.</p>

<p>Fleming saw that the game was up and promptly
darted off into the wood at the side of the road.</p>

<p>“After him, Jim!” cried Joe. “Don’t let him
get away!”</p>

<p>Jim darted after the fugitive. Fleming put on
all possible speed, but he was no match for the
seasoned athlete, and a moment later Jim’s muscular
hand had him by the collar.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” snarled the wretch, struggling desperately.</p>

<p>“Come along,” growled Jim, dragging him to
the spot in the road where Joe was comforting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Mabel, who was gradually getting back some of
her self-control.</p>

<p>The tender look in Joe’s eyes was replaced by
one of a different character as he looked at the
flushed, dissipated face of the man who stood before
him, still held by Jim.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Beckworth Fleming, I have an account
to settle with you.”</p>

<p>Fleming shrank back as far as Jim’s grip
would let him before the steely look in Joe’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said Joe, contemptuously.
“I’m not going to thrash you in the presence of a
lady.”</p>

<p>Relief came into Fleming’s face.</p>

<p>“It was only a lark,” he began, but Joe cut
him short.</p>

<p>“I don’t care for any explanations,” he said.
“I want you to go down on your knees in the road
and beg Miss Varley’s pardon.”</p>

<p>Fleming looked around for some means of escape
but found none. His furtive glance at Mabel
fell before the scorn in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I apologize,” he jerked out sullenly.</p>

<p>“Down on your knees, I said,” remarked Joe
with dangerous calmness.</p>

<p>Fleming hesitated before this last humiliation,
but Jim’s knuckles in his neck decided him.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he muttered, getting down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
on his knees and scrambling again to his feet as
hastily as possible.</p>

<p>“And now, Jim,” Joe continued, “if you’ll just
take Mabel up the road a little way around that
curve, I’ll finish this little account with Mr. Fleming.”</p>

<p>Fear sprang into Fleming’s eyes.</p>

<p>“You said you wouldn’t,” he began.</p>

<p>“I said I wouldn’t thrash you in the presence of
a lady, and I’m going to keep my word,” said Joe,
imperturbably. “Please, Jim.”</p>

<p>He relinquished Mabel to his friend, and Jim
assumed the responsibility with a cheerful grin.</p>

<p>“Don’t hurt him, Joe,” Mabel urged, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“I won’t kill him, Mabel,” Joe answered. “I
only want to impress a few things on his memory
so firmly that he’ll never forget them.”</p>

<p>Jim gently urged Mabel out of sight beyond a
curve two hundred feet away.</p>

<p>When they had vanished, Joe turned to Fleming.</p>

<p>“Take off your coat,” he ordered curtly.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Fleming,
fearfully. “I warn you that if you hit me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Take off your coat,” repeated Joe, setting him
the example.</p>

<p>As Fleming still hesitated, Joe reached over
and slapped his face lightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“You seem to need a stimulant to get you going,”
he taunted.</p>

<p>Even a rat will fight when cornered, and Fleming,
with an exclamation of rage, threw off his
coat and rushed furiously at Joe.</p>

<p>The latter met him with an uppercut that shook
him from head to foot. Then he sailed into Fleming
and gave him a most thorough thrashing.
Nor did he let up until Fleming with a highly decorated
face lay helpless in the road, sobbing with
shame and rage and whining for mercy.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s enough for the present,” said
Joe, who had not a mark on him, as he resumed
his coat. “You’d better get into that car of yours
and drive home before your eyes are entirely
closed. And remember that this isn’t a circumstance
to what you’ll get if you ever dare to speak
to Miss Varley again.”</p>

<p>He turned his back upon the discomfited cad,
and, jumping into the runabout, drove around the
curve where he rejoined Mabel and Jim.</p>

<p>“Did you impress those things on his memory?”
asked Jim with a grin.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he’ll forget them in a hurry,” Joe
laughed, though rather grimly. “And this time,
luckily, there was no policeman handy.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>PLANNING FOR REVENGE</small></h2>


<p>“I hope you didn’t injure him too much, Joe,”
said Mabel, snuggling close to him in the crowded
little runabout.</p>

<p>“Do I look like a murderer?” chaffed Joe.</p>

<p>“But really, Joe, what did you do to him?”
asked Mabel.</p>

<p>“Less than the rascal deserved,” Joe answered.
“He got a good thrashing; and it was surely coming
to him. I don’t think he’ll ever trouble you
again.”</p>

<p>“I was so relieved when I caught sight of you
in this car,” sighed Mabel.</p>

<p>“How did it happen that you were riding with
him?” asked Joe, as he threw on a little extra
speed.</p>

<p>“He was out at the Country Club when Reggie
and I reached there,” Mabel replied. “I hadn’t
told Reggie how he had acted the last time he
called at the Marlborough, because I didn’t want
to make trouble, and I thought after the way I cut
him then he’d never bother me again. But he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
dining at the Country Club with a party of friends
that we both knew, and I couldn’t make a scene
without being conspicuous. I avoided him, however,
as much as I could.</p>

<p>“You know, of course, Reggie’s car is in New
York and we were using a hired machine. When
we were getting ready to come away, I had just
stepped into the car when Reggie was called to
the telephone. This man, Fleming, was standing
by, and before I knew it he jumped in, took the
wheel, and started the auto going.</p>

<p>“I ordered him to stop, but he only kept going
faster. He had been drinking, and he was loud
and boisterous. I begged and threatened, but he
only laughed and went on at a greater speed. Said
he was going to get even with me for the cut I had
given him the other night, and was going to take
me on a long ride whether I wanted to go or not.</p>

<p>“I never was so frightened in all my life. I told
him that my friends and my brother would punish
him for what he was doing, but he only laughed
and said they would have to catch him first. I
hoped a policeman would stop us, for he was going
at a furious rate. Then I thought of jumping,
though I knew I would probably be killed if
I did. I screamed, but we were going at such a
rate and making so much noise that no one heard
me. Then I caught sight of you, and when I
looked back and waved and saw that you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
coming after us, I knew that everything would be
all right. Oh, Joe, it seems as though you are
always on hand when I need you most.”</p>

<p>Her nerves had been so badly shaken that she
was on the verge of tears again, and she fumbled
for her absurdly little handkerchief in the cuff of
her sleeve.</p>

<p>Joe’s heart thrilled, and if Jim had not been
there and he could have taken his hands from the
wheel, he would have comforted her again as he
had on the road.</p>

<p>“I’d have followed you to the end of the world,”
he said rather huskily.</p>

<p>“How lucky it was that that freight train just
happened to be passing at the time,” chuckled Jim.
“Can’t you imagine how desperate Fleming must
have been when he saw the way barred?”</p>

<p>“It was a friend in need for us, all right,”
grinned Joe. “Fleming wasn’t quite tipsy enough
to try to butt the train off the tracks.”</p>

<p>“He ought to sue the railroad for damages,”
Jim suggested.</p>

<p>“He might get them, too,” laughed Joe. “If
a jury saw his face as it is just now, they’d know
that he’d been in a mix-up of some kind.”</p>

<p>They found Reggie in a state of great bewilderment
and agitation at the hotel. They had told
him at the club that Fleming had driven off with
Mabel, and though he had not known of the latter’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
offensive behavior toward his sister previously,
he knew that Fleming had been drinking
that afternoon and was in no condition to handle
a car.</p>

<p>He was enormously relieved, therefore, when
he saw Mabel return safely, though he wondered
to see her escorted by Joe and Jim.</p>

<p>They told him all the circumstances and he was
furious. He was for starting out at once to hunt
up Fleming, but Joe dissuaded him.</p>

<p>“He’s had a good trimming already,” Joe assured
him. “We don’t want anything that may
bring notoriety to Mabel’s name. I don’t imagine
we’ll ever be bothered by him again.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Fleming, left battered and
disheveled on the country road, was wild with
pain and rage. His heart was a tumult of seething
emotions. He had undergone that afternoon more
humiliation than comes to most men in a lifetime.
He had been thwarted in his impudent venture.
He had been taken by the collar and shaken as a
rat by a terrier. He had had to get down on his
knees in the dirt of the road and humbly apologize.
And then he had been bruised and beaten
until he had begged for mercy.</p>

<p>He ground his teeth in unavailing fury. He
had been accustomed all his life to have his way.
Money had made his path easy. He was not used
to the sensation of being the “under dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>He took out his handkerchief and wiped the
blood and dust from his face, brushed and adjusted
his disarranged clothing as well as he could,
then climbed into the car and by a roundabout
route made his way back to town.</p>

<p>His first visit was to a Turkish bath where he
attempted to have some of the soreness rubbed
from his battered frame. Then he visited one of
the facial artists who make a specialty of painting
black eyes into some semblance of flesh color.</p>

<p>In this way he managed to efface the worst
traces of the afternoon’s encounter, though his
face still remained somewhat swelled and puffy.
Then he set out to make a night of it and drown
his troubles in the way with which he was the most
familiar.</p>

<p>He was seated at a table in a crowded café
patronized chiefly by gamblers, when he was accosted
by a friend whose dissipated face showed
that he was of the same type as Fleming.</p>

<p>“Hello, old man,” said the former. “Drinking
here all by your lonesome?”</p>

<p>“How are you, Bixby,” responded Fleming.
“Sit down here and have something with me.”</p>

<p>His friend did so and Fleming motioned to the
waiter and ordered a couple of drinks.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with your face, Fleming?”
asked Bixby, as he looked at his friend
curiously. “Been in a scrap?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing like that,” lied Fleming in a surly
tone. “Ran a car into a ditch and had an upset.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t improve your beauty any,” laughed
his friend lightly. “Still, you can’t kick if you’ve
come out of a smash with nothing worse than that.
What are you doing here in Boston, anyway?
Come over to see the game?”</p>

<p>Fleming growled a moody assent.</p>

<p>“They say Matson is going to pitch to-morrow,”
Bixby continued.</p>

<p>Fleming greeted the mention of the name with
a lurid outburst that left no doubt as to his feelings.</p>

<p>His friend looked at him with surprise.</p>

<p>“You seem to be horribly sore,” he ventured.
“I thought that like most New Yorkers you’d be
rooting for him to win.”</p>

<p>“I hope they knock him out of the box,” Fleming
hissed, with the venom of a snake.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>THE PLOT</small></h2>


<p>“There are lots of people in Boston hoping
the same thing,” replied Bixby. “But I think
they’re due to be disappointed. It isn’t often they
send that boy back to the shower.”</p>

<p>“He can be beaten like any one else,” snarled
Fleming, his gorge rising as he heard Joe praised.</p>

<p>“Sure,” conceded Bixby. “The best of them
have an off day at times. But they say he’s in
splendid shape just now. That arm of his is certainly
a dandy.”</p>

<p>Fleming could have told him better than any
one else just how good that stalwart arm was.
Not four hours had passed since he had tested its
strength. And he knew that it was good for something
besides baseball.</p>

<p>But not for the world would he have had that
beating come to light. It would make him the
laughing stock of the clubs. He was sure that
Joe himself would not tell of it nor would Reggie,
because of their desire to prevent Mabel’s
name being dragged into the affair. So that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
secret was safe, unless he himself should reveal
it while he was in his cups.</p>

<p>“He’s a false alarm,” he growled. “Lots of
these fellows start out as though they were going
to set the league afire, but after a year or two you
find them back again in the minors. They go up
like a rocket and come down like the stick.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s a false alarm, he’s deceived a
good many people,” answered Bixby with a diminished
respect for his friend’s judgment. “All the
dope is that he’s going to be another Hughson.”</p>

<p>They drained their glasses and ordered more
liquor. While they were waiting for it to come,
Bixby glanced around the café. His eye rested on
a table in the further corner of the room where
three men were sitting.</p>

<p>“Do you see that big fellow over there with the
other two?” he asked Fleming.</p>

<p>“I see him,” replied Fleming, shortly.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s Big Connelly the notorious Chicago
sporting man,” returned Bixby.</p>

<p>“Well, what if it is?” said Fleming, indifferently.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing special, except that he seems to
feel a good deal the same way about Matson that
you do. I was sitting near him just before I came
over here to join you and he was grouching to
beat the band.”</p>

<p>“Is that so!” ejaculated Fleming with a quickening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of interest. “What does he seem to have
against him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s more than I know,” was the reply.
“But he seems to have a bitter grudge from the
way he talks.”</p>

<p>“Do you know Connelly personally?” demanded
Fleming.</p>

<p>“In a way I do,” replied Bixby. “I met him at
a prize fight once in Chicago and was introduced
to him. I don’t know whether he’d remember
me or not. But why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to meet him if you don’t mind,” answered
Fleming.</p>

<p>Bixby was somewhat surprised but did not object,
and the two wended their way among the
tables till they came to the one in question.</p>

<p>“How are you, Mr. Connelly?” said Bixby. “I
don’t know whether you recall me, but I met you
at that Welsh-Leonard bout in Chicago last year.
Bixby is my name.”</p>

<p>It was Connelly’s business to recollect faces, or
to pretend to even if he did not.</p>

<p>“Sure, I remember you,” he replied with the
real or assumed heartiness of his class. “Glad to
see you again, Mr. Bixby.”</p>

<p>“This is my friend, Mr. Fleming,” introduced
Bixby.</p>

<p>Connelly’s shrewd eyes appraised Fleming as
one of the “idle rich,” the plucking of whom had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
often feathered his nest, and his greeting was
cordial.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down and have something with
us?” he inquired, introducing the two men who
were with him and making room at the table.</p>

<p>“We’d be glad to if we’re not intruding,” replied
Bixby.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Connelly, and to seal the acquaintance
he ordered a bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>It was not long before they were talking freely,
and it goes without saying that in the one engrossing
thought that prevailed everywhere they fell
to discussing the World Series.</p>

<p>Connelly&mdash;“Big” Connelly, to give him the
name by which he was usually referred to&mdash;was,
as his name implied, a ponderous man with a hard,
smooth-shaven face and cold, calculating eyes. He
was a hardened “sport” and a shrewd politician,
with strings out everywhere in the underworld that
he could pull when he felt so inclined. He was
wholly unscrupulous and stopped at nothing to
achieve his ends.</p>

<p>“I hear you’re expecting Boston to win the Series,
Mr. Connelly,” remarked Bixby.</p>

<p>“I’ve picked ’em to win,” agreed Connelly, “and
I think they would to a dead certainty if it weren’t
for one thing, or perhaps I ought to say one man.”</p>

<p>“And that one man is Matson, I suppose?” put
in Fleming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Exactly,” frowned Connelly. “With him out
of the way it would be a walk-over for the
Sox.”</p>

<p>“You’d go into mourning if he broke a leg or
anything like that,” grinned Bixby.</p>

<p>“No such luck,” grunted Connelly. “Nothing
ever happens to that bird. He must carry a horseshoe
around with him. I came all the way from
Chicago to see Brennan’s team win, only to see
Matson smear a defeat on them. But it isn’t that
I’m sore about especially.”</p>

<p>“Some little personal feeling, eh?” ventured
Fleming, tentatively.</p>

<p>“He turned me down on a little deal once,”
Connelly spat out viciously, “and I’ve vowed to
get even with him some time.”</p>

<p>He refrained from explaining that the “deal”
referred to had been a crooked bit of work that
he had dared to suggest to Joe at the time the latter
was with St. Louis and the club was struggling
to get to the head of the second division. Not only
had Joe rejected the proposition hard and instantly,
but Connelly had only saved his face from
disfigurement by beating a hasty and undignified
retreat. From that moment he had cherished a
bitter grudge against the man who had humiliated
him, and this was intensified at the present by the
young pitcher’s popularity.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir-ee,” he grunted vindictively, “I’d give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
ten thousand dollars to have Matson put on the
shelf.”</p>

<p>“You could have him put out of the way for a
good deal less than that,” suggested one of his
companions, an evil-faced man named Moriarity.
“There are fellows in New York or Boston who
would do it for a thousand.”</p>

<p>“Nix on that stuff,” growled Connelly. “You
could get away with a good many things, but you
couldn’t get away with that. You might as well
try to do away with the President. Any one who
puts the extinguisher on Matson would go to the
electric chair sure, and nothing could save him.
Even if he got off, the public would tear him to
pieces. Forget it.”</p>

<p>Moriarity was squelched and shrank back before
the big man’s disapproval.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” ruminated Connelly, “I wish
I could think of something that didn’t have any
come-back.”</p>

<p>A thought suddenly came into Fleming’s mind,
but he hesitated to express it in the presence of
Bixby, who was an ardent partisan of the New
Yorks. He sat toying with his glass and turning
the idea over in his mind.</p>

<p>It was a relief to him when Bixby rose a few
minutes later and left them on the ground of an
engagement. Fleming hitched his chair a little
closer to Connelly’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve just thought of something that may help
you out a little, Mr. Connelly,” he began.</p>

<p>Connelly looked at him in curiosity.</p>

<p>“Let’s hear it,” he said eagerly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>WEAVING THE WEB</small></h2>


<p>The four at the table put their heads together,
and Fleming lowered his voice so that he might
not be overheard by those in the adjacent
chairs.</p>

<p>“Of course, I don’t know whether we can make
the thing work,” commenced Fleming a little diffidently,
“but it won’t do any harm to figure it out
and see what there is in it.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” said Connelly, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“As you say, it won’t do to injure Matson physically,”
Fleming went on. “Though nothing
would suit me better,” he added with sudden savageness,
as the stinging recollection of that afternoon’s
events came back to him.</p>

<p>“I see that he isn’t exactly popular with you,”
grinned Connelly. He reflected that this man
might be a valuable aid to him, if he nourished a
personal grudge.</p>

<p>But it was not in Fleming’s mind to betray himself,
and he pulled up short.</p>

<p>“As I was saying,” he continued, without replying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to Connelly’s suggestion, “the public
wouldn’t stand for a minute for any rough work
with Matson. But we can injure him in other
ways.”</p>

<p>“Just how?” asked Connelly.</p>

<p>“Well,” asked Fleming in turn, “what do you
think is the most important thing in the world to
him just now?”</p>

<p>“The World Series,” replied Connelly,
promptly.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” assented Fleming. “It means more
to him just now than anything else on earth. It
means money and reputation and a big future if
he wins. Now if we could knock him out of winning,
we could hit him in his pride, his prestige and
his pocketbook all at the same time, and hit him
hard.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of that,” admitted Connelly, “but
I don’t see just yet what you’re driving at.”</p>

<p>“What I’m driving at is this,” explained Fleming.
“We’ve got, in some way, to keep Matson
from playing. You know as well as I do that he
is the mainstay of the Giant team. That’s especially
the case since Hughson was hurt. Matson’s
the only reliable pitcher they have left. Markwith
is as wild as a hawk and may go up in the
air at any time. Barclay has the stuff, but he’s
green and inexperienced.</p>

<p>“The Red Sox now have won two games to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Giants’ one. The New Yorks must take three
more to win the Series. They’re counting on Matson
to pull out two of them at least, perhaps all
three. I tell you he’s the king pin in the Giant
machine just now, and without him the whole team
would go to pieces.”</p>

<p>“I see your point all right,” said Connelly, “but
with the rough stuff barred I don’t exactly see how
we are going to keep Matson from playing.” He
pondered the problem for a moment with knitted
brows. Then suddenly an idea came to him, and
he brought his fist down on the table with a resounding
thump. “Great Scott!” he cried. “I
believe I’ve got the very thing!”</p>

<p>“Let’s have it,” demanded Fleming, eagerly.</p>

<p>“There’s a pal of mine in this burg,” explained
Connelly, “that’s having all sorts of trouble with
a nephew of his that’s going to the dogs as fast
as he can. The boy has put over one or two phony
checks already that my friend has had to settle
for to keep the kid out of jail.</p>

<p>“My pal has the idea that if the boy could be
shipped out of the country for a long voyage it
would get him away from the gang he’s running
with and might put him in the way of keeping
straight. He was talking to me about it only
yesterday and I promised to help him carry it
through.</p>

<p>“You see, I happen to know an old sea captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
who’s loading up now at a Boston wharf for a trip
to South America. He’s a tough old nut, and he’ll
do almost anything for me, especially if a little
money is slipped to him to sweeten the job. I was
going to propose to him to have this kid I’m telling
you about bundled on board and carried away
with him. But that matter can wait. Now suppose
we’re able to get Matson on board in place
of the other fellow.”</p>

<p>“Great!” cried Fleming excitedly.</p>

<p>“It’s too hot and crowded in here,” declared
Connelly, rising. “Let’s get out somewhere and
fix up the details.”</p>

<p>He dismissed his henchmen, and he and Fleming
strolled down the street till they came to the
Common. They chose a seat in a remote part,
and began to figure out how they could carry their
plan to success.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad that it’s too late to put the thing
through to-night,” regretted Connelly. “I’d like
to put him on the blink for to-morrow’s game.”</p>

<p>“We can’t do that of course,” replied Fleming.
“But even if he wins to-morrow’s game, that will
only even up the Series. There’ll have to be at
least two more games played and maybe three.
We’ll get him then.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go down and see the captain the first thing
in the morning,” said Connelly. “I’m sure he’ll
fall in with it all right. Then the only thing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
remains to be done is to get Matson within his
reach without rousing suspicion.”</p>

<p>“But that’s a mighty big thing,” returned Fleming
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“What time does their train for New York
leave to-morrow night?” asked Connelly.</p>

<p>“Somewhere between eleven and twelve, I believe,”
answered Fleming.</p>

<p>“That’ll give us all the time we want,” declared
Connelly confidently. “Now listen to me.”</p>

<p>“Not quite so loud,” admonished Fleming,
looking around him nervously.</p>

<p>The conspirators lowered their voices and
talked earnestly. It was nearly midnight when
they parted.</p>

<p>The next morning dawned brightly and there
was every promise of a glorious day.</p>

<p>“How are you feeling, Joe?” asked Jim, as the
chums were getting ready to go down to breakfast.</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy and full of pitching,” replied
Joe blithely.</p>

<p>“That sounds good,” rejoiced Jim. “Didn’t
sprain your arm on Fleming yesterday?” he inquired
with a grin.</p>

<p>“Not so that you could notice it,” laughed Joe.
“In fact it was just the exercise I needed. It
made up for having no other practice, kept me
from going stale, as it were.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“It took real friendship to stay around that
curve when I was fairly aching to see you do that
fellow up,” declared Jim.</p>

<p>“I’ll do as much for you some time,” Joe consoled
him.</p>

<p>They had barely finished their meal when word
was brought to Joe that there was somebody
waiting in the lobby to see him.</p>

<p>He went out promptly and was surprised and
pleased to find Mr. Anderson, the old G. A. R.
man who had been knocked down by the automobile
on the Long Island road.</p>

<p>They shook hands heartily.</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad to see you!” exclaimed Joe.
“I didn’t expect you’d be able to get back to Boston
so soon. Those Islip doctors must have been
right on the job.”</p>

<p>“They fixed me up fine,” agreed Louis Anderson.
“Everybody’s been mighty good and kind to
me since I was hurt. You especially, Mr. Matson.
I want to thank you for the money you left
for me with the doctors, and which they handed
to me when I was coming away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Joe, “and half of
that was from Mr. Barclay, the young man who
was with me. Here he comes now,” he added,
as Jim sauntered out of the dining room and
joined them.</p>

<p>He greeted the old man heartily, who thanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
him also for his kindness. Jim waved it away as
a trifle.</p>

<p>“Found out anything yet as to who those fellows
were that ran you down?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” said the old man sadly. “I only
wish I could. I’d make them pay for what they
did to me.”</p>

<p>“And we’d be witnesses for you,” declared Joe
warmly. “It was one of the most brutal things
I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“They ought to be made to pay up handsomely,”
added Jim, “and they’d be mighty lucky to get off
with that.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there isn’t much chance of ever
finding them,” the old man said. “But it wasn’t
that I came to see you especially about this morning,
Mr. Matson. I heard something last night
that I think you ought to know.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked Joe pleasantly. “What is
it?”</p>

<p>“I was on the Common last night,” Anderson
replied. “It was so close and hot that I couldn’t
sleep, and I thought it might do me good to get the
air. I sat down at the foot of a big tree and I
guess I must have gone to sleep. I was waked
up by hearing voices and found that two men were
sitting on a bench the other side of the tree.</p>

<p>“I didn’t pay much attention till I heard one of
them mention your name. Even then I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
they were talking about baseball. But then I
heard one of them say mean things about you. I
perked up then and I heard enough to know that
they were planning to harm you in some way.”</p>

<p>Both ball players were listening now with the
utmost attention.</p>

<p>“Did you hear them call each other by name?”
asked Joe.</p>

<p>“One of them spoke to the other as Mr. Fleming&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fleming!” interrupted Jim, as he shot a quick
glance at Joe.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>A STIRRING BATTLE</small></h2>


<p>“Fleming’s got busy in a hurry!” exclaimed
Joe. “But just what was it they were planning to
do?”</p>

<p>“That’s just the trouble,” answered Anderson.
“I don’t rightly know just what mischief they were
cooking up. They kept their voices pretty low
most of the time, and then, too, my hearing isn’t
any too good, especially since I had that accident.
Once I heard one of them say: ‘It’ll put him on
the toboggan all right.’</p>

<p>“I didn’t dare to stir for fear they’d see me, or
I’d have tried to edge around the tree so as to get
closer to them. But from the number of times
they spoke your name and the ugly way they did
it, I was sure they had it in for you.</p>

<p>“I stayed there until they went away and the
last thing one of them said was: ‘I’ll set the thing
going the first thing in the morning.’ And the
other one said: ‘It can’t start too quick for
me.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you see what kind of looking men they
were?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“I peeked out at them as they were leaving, but
all I could see was that one of them was a big,
heavy man and the other was slimmer and seemed
to have something the matter with his face. It was
puffed up as though he had the toothache.”</p>

<p>“Fleming, sure enough!” ejaculated Jim, grimly.</p>

<p>“I guess I know how he got that toothache,”
Joe remarked grimly.</p>

<p>“Why, is he any one you know?” inquired Anderson.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure I do,” replied Joe. “There
aren’t likely to be two men named Fleming who
want to do me up.”</p>

<p>“Do be careful now, Mr. Matson,” the old man
urged. “I can’t bear to think of anything happening
to you after all that you have done for
me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my eyes open,” answered Joe. “And
I can’t thank you enough, Mr. Anderson, for the
trouble you’ve taken to come and tell me about
this.”</p>

<p>“It’s little enough,” answered Anderson. “I
only wish I could do more. But I know you must
be pretty busy just now, with the big game coming
on, so I’ll just jog along. Hope you have luck to-day,
Mr. Matson.”</p>

<p>He said good-bye and went away. After he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
gone the two friends looked at each other very
long and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, Joe?” asked Jim at
length.</p>

<p>“Why, I hardly know,” replied Baseball Joe,
slowly. “I wish the old man had been able to get
something a little more definite. The only thing
that seems clear is that that snake is trying to make
trouble for me. But, pshaw! ‘Threatened men
live long,’ you know, and I’m not going to worry
about it.”</p>

<p>But Jim was not inclined to dismiss the matter
so lightly.</p>

<p>“Do you think they might try anything like the
drugged coffee game?” he inquired. “Hartley
got away with that once on you, and it might be
done again.”</p>

<p>“Not likely,” answered Joe. “But what’s the
use of worrying? I’m going to put it right out of
my mind for the present. I’ve got to pitch this
afternoon and I’m not going to think of anything
else.”</p>

<p>True to his nefarious promise, Connelly, at just
about the same time that morning, was having a
private conversation with the captain of a tramp
ship that was lying at a wharf far down on the
Boston harbor front.</p>

<p>The tramp was a battered, rusty-looking old
hooker that seemed to be about as tough and disreputable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
looking as the skipper, who was shouting
orders to his crew when Connelly came on
board.</p>

<p>There was a mutual recognition.</p>

<p>“How are you, Mr. Connelly?” the captain
said, as he came forward to greet the newcomer.
“And what is it that’s bringing you so far from
Chicago?”</p>

<p>“How are you, Captain Hennessy?” returned
Connelly, cordially grasping the gnarled hand that
was extended to him. “I happened to be in town
on business and I heard you were loading up here.
How’s the carrying trade just now?”</p>

<p>“None too good,” replied the skipper. “What
with freights ’way down and the competition of
the big liners, it’s all we can do to make a living
these days. But come down to the cabin and wet
your whistle. Talking’s dry business.”</p>

<p>Connelly needed no urging, and they were soon
seated at a table in the cramped cabin, with a bottle
and glasses between them.</p>

<p>They talked of indifferent matters for a time,
and then Connelly broached the object of his
visit.</p>

<p>“Where are you going this trip?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Down the South American coast as far as Rio
Janeiro,” was the answer. “Porto Rico will be my
first stop.”</p>

<p>“And when do you expect to start?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“I may finish up loading to-day if I have luck,”
replied the skipper. “If so, I’ll get my clearance
papers and slip out early to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve done a bit of shanghaiing in
your day, eh, Hennessy?” remarked Connelly,
jocularly.</p>

<p>“Many’s the time, especially in the old sailing
days,” grinned Hennessy, a light of evil reminiscence
in his little eyes. “But there’s little call for
it nowadays.”</p>

<p>“I was just wondering,” went on Connelly, “if
you’d do me a favor and take a fellow along with
you on this trip that doesn’t want to go.”</p>

<p>“It might be managed,” returned the skipper a
little doubtfully.</p>

<p>“There’d be a nice little slice of money in it
for you,” Connelly explained. “You see it’s a
young fellow that’s got in with a wild gang ashore,
and his folks think a sea voyage wouldn’t do him
any harm.”</p>

<p>Hennessy’s hesitation vanished at the mention
of money and his eyes had an avaricious
gleam.</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll do it!” he exclaimed. And then, with
voices slightly lowered, the pair perfected their
scheme.</p>

<p>A little later Connelly left the ship and walked
rapidly away with a triumphant glint in his vulture-like
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>He found his confederate waiting for him in
the same café where they had met the night before.
Fleming jumped up from the table at which
he had been sitting and came rapidly forward to
meet him.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said eagerly.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” responded Connelly. “It didn’t
take much urging to turn the trick. I told you
he’d be only too glad to oblige me.”</p>

<p>He went over the events of the morning rapidly,
and Fleming exulted.</p>

<p>“So far, so good,” he gloated.</p>

<p>“But the hardest part is yet to come,” Connelly
reminded him. “We’ve got the stage set for the
play, and the next thing is to have the chief actor
on hand when the curtain rings up.” And then
the two talked the matter over in detail.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm at Braves Field that afternoon
was at fever heat. The Boston rooters turned out
in the biggest crowd of the Series so far. The last
game their favorites had won filled them with confidence,
and they were out to cheer their pets on to
another victory.</p>

<p>Even the knowledge that Matson was to pitch
for the Giants, which had been featured in the
morning papers, was not sufficient to daunt them.
They felt that luck was with the Red Sox, as had
already been shown in the accident to Hughson
and the rain that had snatched the second game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
from the New Yorks. And that luck, they felt
sure, would persist. The wish may have been
father to the thought, but there was no doubt as
to the optimism that existed in the home town of
the Red Sox.</p>

<p>The Giants faced the test with quiet confidence.
The odd game was against them, but they looked
forward serenely to evening up the score that
afternoon with Baseball Joe in the box.</p>

<p>McRae had a little talk with his team in the
clubhouse before they went out for practice.</p>

<p>“Go right in, boys, and eat them up,” he exhorted
them. “Those fellows never saw the day
they could beat you if you were doing your best.</p>

<p>“They’ll probably put in Roth against you.
He’s a good southpaw, but southpaws are just
your meat. Look out for that ‘bean’ ball of his.
He’s sure to use it in trying to drive you away
from the plate. But don’t let it rattle you for a
minute. Be quick to dodge, though, for I don’t
want to have any of you hurt at this stage of the
Series.</p>

<p>“And don’t let Matson do it all. He can’t
carry the whole team on his shoulders. No matter
how well he pitches, he can’t win unless you bat
in some runs. Hand him a few right from the
start.</p>

<p>“Little old New York is rooting for you to win,
boys. Don’t fall down on the job. You’ll own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the city if you come back with a row of Boston
scalps at your belt. And I know you can do it if
you try. Go in and wallop the life out of ’em.”</p>

<p>There was a cheer which told McRae that his
words had gotten “under the skin,” and the Giants
dashed briskly out on the field.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>EVENING UP THE SCORE</small></h2>


<p>When the gong rang, the Giants started out
as though they were going to sew up the game
then and there.</p>

<p>Burkett set the ball rolling with a wicked drive
through the box that got past Roth before he
could gauge it. Larry followed suit with a smoking
hit to left. A prettily placed sacrifice bunt by
Denton advanced both men a base. Roth struck
out Willis on three pitched balls, but Becker came
to the rescue with a line drive over second that
scored Burkett easily, though Larry was put out
as he made a great slide for the rubber.</p>

<p>The net result was only one run, but the most
encouraging feature of the inning was the exhibition
of free hitting.</p>

<p>“Three clean hits in one time at bat is going
some,” Robson exulted.</p>

<p>“The boys seem to have their batting clothes
on for fair,” responded McRae, vastly pleased.</p>

<p>“I doubt if that bird will come again for more,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
judged “Robbie.” “They’ll probably take him
out and put Fraser in.”</p>

<p>Joe was in fine fettle, and he showed his appreciation
of the lead his mates had given him by
retiring the Red Sox without a man seeing first
base.</p>

<p>Contrary to Robson’s prediction, the Boston
manager elected still to pin his faith to Roth, who
tightened up after his bad start and for the next
three innings held the Giants scoreless.</p>

<p>He was helped in this by the superb support
given him. Both the outfield and infield were on
their toes all the time, and drives that ordinarily
would have gone for hits were turned into outs in
dazzling fashion.</p>

<p>One magnificent catch by Thompson, the Red
Sox catcher, was the feature of the fourth inning.
Iredell, who was at bat, sent up a sky-piercing
foul. Thompson, Hobbs and Roth started for it.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it, I’ve got it!” yelled Thompson.</p>

<p>The others stopped and Thompson kept on.</p>

<p>The ball swerved toward the Boston dugout,
where the substitutes and extra pitchers of the
team were sitting.</p>

<p>A shout of warning went up, but Thompson
did not falter. With his eye on the ball and his
hands outstretched, he plunged ahead.</p>

<p>He grabbed the ball in a terrific forward lunge
and went head over heels into the dugout, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
his comrades caught him and saved him from injury.
But he still clutched the ball as he was put
on his feet, and a tempest of applause went up
in which even the Giants and their partisans could
not help joining.</p>

<p>“Suffering cats!” exclaimed McRae. “That was
a miracle catch.”</p>

<p>“Never saw a better one in all my years on the
ball field,” Robson conceded generously.</p>

<p>Thompson was forced to remove his cap again
and again before the crowds would stop their
cheering, and the play put still greater stiffness
into the Boston’s defence.</p>

<p>But they needed something more than a stone
wall defence. They had a lead of one run to
overcome, and at the rate Joe was mowing them
down, this seemed a tremendous obstacle.</p>

<p>Joe had never felt in better form. He had
superb control and had not yet issued a pass. His
mastery of the ball seemed almost uncanny. It
seemed to understand him and obeyed his slightest
wish.</p>

<p>His speed was dazzling, and the ball zipped
over the plate as though propelled by a gun.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you line it out?” growled the Boston
manager, as one of his players came back discomfited
to the bench.</p>

<p>“How can I hit ’em if I can’t see ’em,” the
player grunted in excuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>But Joe did not rely wholly upon speed. Every
once in a while he mixed in a slow one that looked
as big as a balloon as it sailed lazily toward the
plate. But when the batter almost broke his back
in reaching for it, the ball would drop suddenly
beneath the bat and go plunk into the catcher’s
mitt.</p>

<p>“If I only dared to pitch that boy in all the
remaining games of the Series!” thought McRae
to himself. “He’s just making monkeys of those
fellows.”</p>

<p>For six full innings the score remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Then the storm broke, and a perfect deluge of
hits rained from the Giants’ bats.</p>

<p>Becker began it by whaling out a terrific drive
to center that netted three bases. Iredell followed
with a one cushion jolt between second and short
that scored Becker. Joe pumped one to center
that was good for a base; and on the futile throw
made to third to catch Iredell, Joe by fast running
got as far as second. Mylert went out on
an infield fly, but the burly Burkett clouted a
screaming triple to right, scoring both of his
mates while he rested, grinning, at third.</p>

<p>Pandemonium broke loose among the Giant
rooters. Roth, at a signal from his manager,
drew off his glove, and Landers took his place.</p>

<p>But the Giants were on a batting spree and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
would not be denied. Larry and Denton cracked
out singles. Willis went out on a long fly to right,
but Curry pounded out a two-bagger that cleared
the bases. A moment later he was caught stealing
third and the inning ended.</p>

<p>It had netted the Giants six runs, and they were
now in the lead by seven to nothing.</p>

<p>“Talk about a Waterloo!” shouted Jim, as he
fairly hugged Joe in his delight.</p>

<p>“What do you think they’re doing around the
bulletin boards in New York just now?” Joe
laughed happily.</p>

<p>He was about to pull on his glove to go into
the box when McRae stopped him.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve done enough for to-day, Joe,”
he said. “I want to save that arm of yours all I
can, and with the lead we’ve got now the game
seems to be cinched. I’m going to put Markwith
in for the rest of it.”</p>

<p>Markwith had few superiors when it came to
working for a few innings. His arm was fresh,
and his terrific speed carried him through, although
he was scored on once in the ninth.</p>

<p>The Giants, “just for luck,” added two more
runs in the remaining innings, and when they gathered
up their bats at the end of the game the
score was nine to one in the Giants’ favor.</p>

<p>“This is the end of a perfect day,” chanted Jim
as the hilarious team hurried from the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not quite perfect,” objected Larry with a grin.</p>

<p>“Why, what more do you want, you old glutton?”
put in Willis.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have made it a goose egg for the
Sox,” responded Larry.</p>

<p>“Some folks never know when they have
enough,” remarked Joe. “I’m not kicking a single
bit. That was mighty sweet hitting the boys did
to-day,” he added.</p>

<p>“And mighty sweet pitching, too,” returned
Larry. “Don’t forget that.”</p>

<p>The train did not leave until 11:30 P. M.; so
that they had ample time for leisurely preparation.
Joe and Jim dined with their party, who
were quite as joyous over the result of the game
as themselves. After dinner the young men took
a quiet little stroll with Mabel and Clara and
returned about nine.</p>

<p>The girls had left them to make ready for their
trip, when Joe was summoned to the telephone.</p>

<p>“Hello, Joe,” came over the wire. “This is
McRae talking.”</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Mac,” Joe answered. “I didn’t
recognize your voice at first.”</p>

<p>“The connection isn’t very good, I guess,” was
the answer. “But listen, Joe. I want you to do
me a favor.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” replied Joe promptly. “What is
it?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>A HOLE IN THE WEB</small></h2>


<p>“It’s like this,” came the response. “I’m making
a call on an old yachting friend of mine whom
I always drop in to see when I’m in Boston. He’s
a thirty-third degree fan, but he’s laid up with
rheumatism and can’t get to the games. I’ve been
bragging to him what a pitcher you are, and he
wants to meet you. Would you mind running
down just for a few minutes? It won’t take you
long.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” answered Joe. “Where
are you and just how can I get to you?”</p>

<p>“His yacht is lying off Spring Street wharf.
He’ll have a motor boat there to meet you and
bring you over. A taxi will bring you to the
wharf in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“That’s bully. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Joe hung up the receiver and looked around for
Jim to leave a message with him explaining his
short absence. But Barclay was not in sight at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the moment, and Joe hastily put on his hat, dashed
out, hailed a taxicab, and a moment later was
being whizzed uptown.</p>

<p>Not more than ten minutes had passed before
the cab drew up at the end of the pier, which at
that time was almost deserted.</p>

<p>“Here you are, sir,” announced the driver.</p>

<p>Joe stepped out and paid him.</p>

<p>A large motor boat lay at the pier. As Joe
looked around, a man stepped forward.</p>

<p>“This Mr. Matson, sir?” he questioned respectfully.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>“Mr. McRae told us to wait for you here, sir.
The yacht’s lying a little way out. Will you step
on board, sir?”</p>

<p>Joe stepped into the boat, the moorings were
cast off, and to the “chug chug” of the engine the
boat darted out on the dark waters of the
bay.</p>

<p>Joe took his seat on a padded cushion at the
stern, noticing as he did so that there were several
husky figures sprawling up near the bow.</p>

<p>The cool night air was very grateful after the
heat of the day, and Joe took off his straw hat, so
as to get the full benefit of the breeze.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed, and Joe began to wonder
that they had not reached the yacht where
McRae was waiting for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“How far out did you say the yacht was?” he
asked casually of the man who was steering.</p>

<p>The man grunted, but made no intelligible
reply.</p>

<p>“I asked you how far out the yacht was,” Joe
repeated, a vague uneasiness beginning to take
possession of him.</p>

<p>At this, a huge figure detached itself from the
group forward and came toward him. It was
Hennessy, a sour and evil smile upon his weather-beaten
face.</p>

<p>“I never heard the old hooker called a yacht
before,” he grinned, “but if you must know, it’s
quite a tidy way down the bay before we come
to it.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. McRae said it was lying just off the
wharf!” exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mr. McRae says more than his
prayers,” was Hennessy’s surly reply.</p>

<p>The words, with all they implied, struck Joe
with the force of a blow. Like a flash, the warning
of Louis Anderson that morning came to his
mind.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he cried, starting to his feet.
“What does this mean? What game are you up
to?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find out soon enough, my bucko,” answered
Hennessy. “In the meantime you’d better
take my tip and keep a civil tongue in your head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
My temper’s rather short, as those who have
sailed with me can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t threaten me!” warned Joe, all his fighting
blood coming to the surface.</p>

<p>At his menacing attitude, the men in front rose
to their feet and moved forward. There were
three of them, which made the combined force
five in number, counting Hennessy and the man
at the wheel.</p>

<p>Joe cast a swift glance around. There were
no boats near at hand which could be reached by
a shout. Nor did he have a ghost of a chance
against the husky figures standing about him. For
the moment the advantage was with the enemy.</p>

<p>An agony of self-reproach overwhelmed him.
Why had he so lightly taken it for granted that
it was McRae at the telephone? Why had he let
the warning of Anderson slip from his mind?</p>

<p>He had fallen into a trap! Where were they
taking him? What was their object? He thought
of Mabel and his family. Into what dread and
consternation they would be plunged by his disappearance!
And his comrades on the team!
What would they think of him?</p>

<p>Hennessy had been watching him keenly.</p>

<p>“Easy does it,” he remarked. “If you want a
rough house you can have it, but take a fool’s
advice and don’t go to starting it. We’re too
many for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>There was sound sense in the advice, unpalatable
as it was, and Joe recognized it. He must
temporize. He wanted to dash his fist into the
ugly face before him, and he promised himself
that luxury later on. But just now he must depend
on that nimble wit of his that had so often
helped him to outguess an opponent.</p>

<p>He sank back in his seat with an affected resignation
that was calculated to put his enemy off
guard. It did so in the present case, as Hennessy
chose to consider the action as a surrender.</p>

<p>“Now you’re acting sensible,” he grunted.
“There ain’t no use butting your head against a
stone wall.”</p>

<p>“Where are you taking me?” asked Joe in a
lifeless tone.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as there’s any harm in telling
you, now that we’ve got so far,” Hennessy answered.
“I’m taking you on board my ship, the
<i>Walrus</i>.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Just to give you a little sea air,” grinned Hennessy.
“Your folks thought it would do you good
to take a short v’yage down the coast.”</p>

<p>“Down the coast?”</p>

<p>“South American coast,” replied the captain
shortly. “You’re on your way to Rio Janeiro.”</p>

<p>Rio Janeiro! Joe’s heart thumped violently.</p>

<p>“You say my folks are in on this,” he said, trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to keep his voice calm. “Just what do you
mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve heard all about that gang you’re running
with and those phony checks, and the like of
that,” answered Hennessy.</p>

<p>“Phony checks?” gasped Joe.</p>

<p>“Don’t be playing innocent,” growled Hennessy
roughly. “You know well enough what I
mean.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve got the wrong man,” persisted Joe.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I never
ran with a gang or handled bad checks. You’ve
picked me up, thinking I was somebody else. I’m
a baseball player, a member of the New York
Giants.”</p>

<p>“They told me you’d probably say something
like that,” retorted Hennessy placidly. “But you
can’t pull any wool over my eyes. I’m too old a
hand for that.”</p>

<p>The man was obdurate, and Joe ceased his useless
efforts to convince him. But he knew now
that his case was desperate, and he summoned all
his coolness to cope with the situation. One project
after another raced through his brain, to be
dismissed as useless.</p>

<p>While they had been talking, the motor boat
had made rapid progress. But now a heavy haze
was settling over the water and the engine slowed
down a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look out, you swab!” shouted Hennessy angrily
to the steersman as the end of a pier loomed
up before them. “Do you want to smash the
boat?”</p>

<p>The man veered off. But in that instant Joe
had acted.</p>

<p>His fist shot out, knocking Hennessy off his seat.
Like lightning, <a href="#image04">Joe jumped on the rail and leaped
for the pier, six feet distant</a>.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_175">JOE JUMPED ON THE RAIL AND LEAPED FOR THE PIER, SIX FEET DISTANT.</a></div>
</div>

<p>It was a long jump from an unstable footing,
but Joe made it and clutched one of the spiles.
It was slimy and slippery, but he held on with all
the strength of his trained muscles. His feet,
swinging wildly about, touched the rung of a ladder.
In another moment he swarmed up it, and
stood panting and breathless on the wharf.</p>

<p>“Back her! Back her!” screamed Hennessy
from the fog. “Don’t let him get away!”</p>

<p>Joe chuckled, as he heard the wild splashing of
the water and the pounding of the screw.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Captain!” he sang out. “Hope I
didn’t spoil your beauty. Give my regards to Rio
Janeiro.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>TAKING THE LEAD</small></h2>


<p>Baseball Joe wasted little time in reaching the
end of the pier. He hailed a cab at the first
thoroughfare he came to and was soon once more
at the hotel.</p>

<p>He found his party ready to start and wondering
where he had gone.</p>

<p>“Where on earth have you been, Joe?” asked
Mabel. “We were beginning to get worried about
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was just called away by a telephone message,”
Joe parried.</p>

<p>He had no desire to let the women of the little
group know that he was being made the victim of
any hostile machinations. They would have magnified
the danger and worried without ceasing.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all right as long as you are here
now,” Mabel said brightly, flashing Joe one of the
dazzling smiles that always made his heart beat
more quickly.</p>

<p>There had been a tenderer note in her voice
ever since he had rescued her from the reckless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
ride on which Fleming had taken her. She
blushed when she remembered how she had taken
refuge in his arms in her first paroxysms of relief.
It had been instinctive, and she had fled to them
as naturally as she would have gone to those
of her brother in similar circumstances. How
strongly those arms had held her and how absolutely
safe they had made her feel!</p>

<p>Barclay had been looking curiously at Joe ever
since the latter had returned. He had been more
alarmed than he would have cared to confess by
his unexplained absence. Knowing his chum so
well, he could see that even now he was laboring
under repressed excitement. But his chance for
an explanation did not come until some time later.
It was only after they had bestowed their charges
in their Pullman car and had said good-night and
had gone forward to the car in which the Giants
were quartered, that Jim was able to relieve his
impatience.</p>

<p>“Come on now, old man, and tell me all about
it,” he demanded.</p>

<p>“All about what?”</p>

<p>“You know well enough. Quit your stalling and
come across with the story. Where did you go?
Who called you up? Get it off your chest.”</p>

<p>Joe readily complied. There was very little he
ever kept from Jim, and just now he felt especially
the need of a confidant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim listened with growing excitement and indignation.</p>

<p>“The hounds!” he exclaimed hotly.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t begin to express it,” said Joe.
“It was about as dirty a piece of business as I
ever heard of. It’s worthy of a reptile like
Fleming.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have him here this minute,” cried
Jim. “I’d repeat the dose you gave him yesterday.”</p>

<p>“What puzzles me is as to who was in cahoots
with him,” mused Joe. “He couldn’t have put a
thing like that through alone. Think of the wires
that had to be pulled to carry out the plan.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the big fellow that Anderson heard
talking with Fleming was at the bottom of that,”
conjectured Jim. “It surely was smooth work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was all prearranged carefully enough,”
agreed Joe. “There wasn’t anything left to
chance.”</p>

<p>“It was pretty slick, using McRae’s name to
get you there, too,” commented Jim. “They
knew you’d do anything he asked that was reasonable.
What beats me is how they could counterfeit
his voice so that you were taken in by it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know how it is,” Joe replied.
“When any one at the telephone gives you his
name you take it for granted. It sounded a little
strange, but it was a pretty good imitation at that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Probably they’ve rung in some actor who’s accustomed
to mimic voices. He could easily have hung
around the hotel and listened to Mac talking, till
he got a pretty good line on his voice. Where I
blame myself is that I hadn’t kept Anderson’s
warning in mind. But I was thinking of other
things&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted Jim dryly. “You’d just been
walking with a charming young lady. I understand.”</p>

<p>He grinned quizzically, and Joe made a friendly
thrust toward him which he adroitly ducked.</p>

<p>“Well, ‘all’s well that ends well,’” Joe quoted.</p>

<p>“If it <em>is</em> ended,” said Jim seriously. “They
may cook up something else, now that this has
failed.”</p>

<p>“I guess they’ve shot their bolt,” replied Joe
lightly. “This will probably discourage them, and
they’ll give it up. But it gives me the cold shivers
to think how nearly they put this scheme of theirs
across.”</p>

<p>“It was just touch and go,” agreed Jim. “You
did some mighty quick thinking, old man,” he
added admiringly.</p>

<p>“It was a case of must,” answered Joe. “I just
had to think quickly, or it would have been all up.”</p>

<p>“By the way, are you going to say anything to
McRae about this?”</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” returned Joe. “There’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
nothing he could do. It would only worry him
and make him hopping mad, and he’s got enough
on his mind as it is. Besides, I couldn’t tell him
the whole story without bringing Mabel’s name
into it, and I’d rather cut off my hand than do
that.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment McRae came through the
car. He was in high spirits, and greeted them
cordially as he sat down by them.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you boys better have your berths
made up?” he inquired. “It’s getting pretty late
and I want you to be in good shape for to-morrow.
We’ll want that game badly, too. It isn’t
enough to have evened up. We want to jump
right out into the lead.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re going to pitch Markwith to-morrow,”
said Joe, after having signaled the porter
and told him to prepare the berths.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure yet,” answered McRae thoughtfully.
“He certainly pitched pretty good ball in
those last three innings to-day, and I’ll see how
he warms up to-morrow before the game. But
just at this present moment I’m inclined to pitch
Barclay.”</p>

<p>Jim’s heart began to thump. He had not expected
to figure in the Series, except perhaps as
a relief pitcher. It was his first year in the big
league and though he had shown some “crackerjack
stuff,” he was not supposed to be seasoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
enough to work a full game at such a critical time.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, he would not have had a
chance of taking part if it had not been for the
accident to Hughson. McRae was famous for the
way he stuck to his veterans, and though he believed
in “young blood,” he always took a long
time in developing his new pitchers before he
would trust them in a game on which a great deal
depended. Sometimes he kept them on the bench
for a year or two, absorbing “inside stuff” and
watching the older players before he considered
them ripe for “a killing.”</p>

<p>But he was hard put to it now to handle his
crippled staff to the best advantage. He did not
dare to use Joe too often for fear of hurting his
effectiveness by overwork. Markwith was brilliant
but unreliable. Sometimes he would pitch
superbly for the better part of a game. Then
all too often there would be a fatal inning when
he would lose his “stuff” entirely, and before he
could be replaced the game would have gone to
pieces.</p>

<p>“I may pitch Jim to-morrow,” McRae went on
reflectively. “If he wins, we will have the edge
on the Sox, and I can take a chance on Red for
Friday’s game. Then I’ll have you, Joe, to put
the kibosh on them in the final game on Saturday.</p>

<p>“But if Jim loses to-morrow the Sox will have
three games tucked away and only need one more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
In that case, Joe, I’m going to pitch you Friday
to even up and Saturday to win. Think you can
stand two games in succession and win out?”</p>

<p>“I’d work my head off to do it,” replied Joe
earnestly.</p>

<p>“It’ll put a big strain on your head and arm
too,” said the manager, “but you’ll have all winter
to rest up in afterwards, and we may have
to chance it.”</p>

<p>He chatted with them a minute or two longer,
and then, as the berth had been made up, he left
them.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, Joe!” ejaculated Jim, as he crept
into the upper berth, his teeth chattering in his
excitement. “To think of me pitching a game in
the World Series before that whale of a crowd
at the Polo Grounds!”</p>

<p>“It’s the chance of your life, Jim,” responded
Joe. “You’re made as a pitcher if you win. And
you will win, too. I’m sure of it. You had those
fellows right on your staff in that inning or two
you pitched at Boston.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s hoping,” murmured Jim, getting
in between the sheets. “If I don’t, it won’t be for
lack of trying.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a “whale of a crowd” that
greeted the Giants on their victorious return. All
New York was jubilant, and comments were rife
everywhere on the gameness of their pets in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
fight they were making against accident and hard
luck.</p>

<p>The team was cheered singly and collectively
as they came on the field and scattered for preliminary
practice. McRae and Robson paid especial
attention to the warming up of the pitchers,
for up to the last minute the manager was undecided
as to whom he should play.</p>

<p>Both Jim and Markwith seemed to have plenty
of “smoke” as they sent their slants and benders
over. But the older pitcher was inclined to be
wild, while Jim’s control was all that could be
asked. So with many inner quakings McRae
finally decided that Jim should do the twirling.</p>

<p>The crowd was somewhat startled when they
saw the young “second string” pitcher going on
the mound. They were well aware of McRae’s
predilection for his old players, and they wondered
at his willingness to-day to take a chance.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been their misgivings,
there was nothing but the heartiest applause for
the youngster. If generous rooting and backing
would help him to win, he should have them.</p>

<p>There was a host of Princeton men there, too,
and they gave the old college yell that Jim had
heard so often when as an undergraduate he had
twirled for the Orange and Black.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, if the truth were told, Jim’s
greatest incentive came from the fact that Clara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
was watching him from a box in the upper stand,
her pretty face flushed and her bright eyes sparkling.
It was astonishing how much that young
woman’s approbation had come to mean to Jim
in the short time he had known her.</p>

<p>He was a little nervous at the start, and
Cooper, the first man up, drew a base on balls.
He was nipped a moment later, however, in an
attempt to steal, and with the bases again empty
Jim fanned Berry and made Loomis chop a
grounder to Larry that resulted in an easy out at
first.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, old man!” cried Joe, encouragingly.
“You got through that inning finely.
The first is usually the hardest because you’re finding
your bearings. Besides, you’ve got rid of the
head of their batting order.”</p>

<p>Fraser was in the box for the Red Sox, and it
looked at the start as though he were going to
prove fully as good as in the first game. For four
innings he turned back the New Yorks, who
seemed to have lost all the hitting ability they had
shown the day before.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the boys?” growled
McRae, uneasily. “It would help Barclay a lot
if they handed him something to go on.”</p>

<p>The New Yorks gave him that lead in the fifth.
Denton and Willis singled, and Denton scored
when Cooper, the right fielder, lost Becker’s fly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
in the sun and it went for a double. Becker was
forced at third on Iredell’s bouncer to Girdner,
and both Willis and Iredell scored when Berry
made a wild throw of a sharp hit by Curry.</p>

<p>This ended the scoring for the inning, but those
three runs, in the words of Robson, looked very
“juicy.”</p>

<p>The lead, of course, was very gratifying to Jim.
It seemed to put him on “easy street.” But at
the same time it was dangerous, because it was
calculated to give him, perhaps, too much confidence.
And over-confidence was a perilous thing
to indulge in when the Bostons happened to be
one’s opponents.</p>

<p>Jim waked up to this fact in the very next inning,
when Walters straightened out one of his incurves
with a mighty wallop to the fence on which
he easily circled the bases. Two more hits sandwiched
in with a pass yielded one more run, and
McRae began to look uneasy. A rattling double
play got Jim out of what had begun to look like
a bad hole, and the rally was choked off then and
there.</p>

<p>It had been a bad inning for him, but Jim was a
thoroughbred, and he braced.</p>

<p>In the next three innings they only garnered
four more hits, and of these only two were “Simon
pure.” Loomis got a hit past Denton when the
latter was running to cover the base. Then Stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
chopped one to the box that took a puzzling bound
and went for a single. Girdner lined out a
scorcher to center in the eighth and Walters sent
one to the same place in the final frame. But this
was the sum total of their endeavors and the
Giants had no need of playing out their half of
the ninth.</p>

<p>It was a very creditable victory for the “kid”
pitcher of the Giants. Once more the New Yorks
had the upper hand in the desperate fight for the
Series. Jim had won his spurs and could count
hereafter on taking his regular turn in the box.</p>

<p>The roars of the crowd were like music in Jim’s
ears. Still more grateful were the praise and congratulations
from his comrades on the team. But,
perhaps, he treasured more than all the shy tribute
that came that evening from the lips of a remarkably
pretty girl.</p>

<p>“You were just splendid to-day, Mr. Barclay,”
said Clara, her eyes shining brightly. “Just splendid!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>PLOTTING MISCHIEF</small></h2>


<p>The feeling in Boston was in marked contrast
to that in the metropolis, when the news was
flashed over the wires that for the second day in
succession the Red Sox had lost.</p>

<p>To be sure they were by no means out of it, and
a victory the next day would leave the clubs even
up. But the odds now were on the New York side,
especially as it was certain that Baseball Joe would
pitch in one of the games.</p>

<p>The Red Sox stood in no particular fear of
Markwith, although his ability was freely recognized.
Still he could be handled. But they had
the profoundest respect for Joe, not to say dread,
and they had begun to share the feeling that he
had the game won when he appeared upon the
mound.</p>

<p>Perhaps by none was this conviction felt more
keenly than by two men who sat at a table in a
café. A groan had just arisen from a throng surrounding
the ticker and in that groan the two men
read defeat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“That makes three games the Giants have
won,” growled Connelly. “One more and the
Series is theirs.”</p>

<p>“But they haven’t won that other one yet,” suggested
Fleming, whose face by this time had renewed
more nearly its usual appearance, “and it’s
up to us to see that they don’t.”</p>

<p>“That sounds good,” growled Connelly. “But
so did our other plan sound good. But you see
what came of it.”</p>

<p>“It not only sounded good but it was good,”
replied Fleming. “You know as well as I do that
we only missed putting it over by an eyelash.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got over wondering yet how Matson
slipped out of that net,” Connelly ruminated. “It
seemed a dead open and shut certainty that we had
him.”</p>

<p>“He’s a slippery customer,” said Fleming, “but
because we didn’t get him once doesn’t say that
we won’t the next time. But whatever we do, we’ll
have to do in a hurry. He’s to be in Boston only
one more day.”</p>

<p>“What was it you were telling me about that
Hartley?” asked Connelly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how much there may be in that,”
answered Fleming, thoughtfully. “The fellow’s
fearfully sore on Matson for some reason or other
that I can’t just make out. He’d like well enough
to do him a personal injury, too, if he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I got him away from the gang he was ranting
to and had a little talk with him. But I wouldn’t
dare trust him to do any rough work. He’s half
full all the time; and then, too, I think he’s a little
crazy. He’d be apt to spill the beans in anything
he might undertake.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing, though, in which he
may be of some help to us. He’s on to the signals
used by the Giant pitchers and he offered to
give them away. That might help some in a close
game.”</p>

<p>“It might,” reflected Connelly. “But it isn’t
sure enough. The pitchers might tumble to the
game and change their signals. Still, we’ll use
him, on the off chance that it may help if we don’t
think of anything better.”</p>

<p>“The only sure way of beating Matson,” observed
Fleming, “is to see that he doesn’t go on
the field at all.”</p>

<p>Connelly looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“Nothing like that,” he grunted. “I’ve told you
already that I wouldn’t stand for any rough stuff.
America wouldn’t be big enough to hold a man
who’d do that.”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses,” retorted Fleming. “Who’s
talking about injuring or killing him? I’m no
more anxious to go to the electric chair than you
are.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the game then?” asked Connelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here’s the dope,” answered Fleming. “You
see by the score that Barclay pitched for the New
Yorks to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Connelly.</p>

<p>“That gives McRae a little margin to go on,”
continued Fleming. “He could afford to lose to-morrow’s
game and still be even on the Series.
Then he’d still have Matson as his ace for Saturday’s
game in New York.</p>

<p>“Now suppose it works out that way. Markwith
pitches, we’ll say, and loses.”</p>

<p>“I’m listening,” said Connelly.</p>

<p>“Then the deciding game will be played on Saturday
at the Polo Grounds. The Giants will be
before their home crowd. Matson goes in to
pitch. What’s the answer?”</p>

<p>“A victory for New York,” replied Connelly,
grinding his teeth.</p>

<p>“Probably,” agreed Fleming. “Now there’s
just one thing to be done. When the Giant team
leaves Boston to-morrow night for New York,
<em>Matson mustn’t go with them</em>.”</p>

<p>He almost hissed the last words, all the venom
he felt toward Joe showing in his eyes.</p>

<p>Connelly thumped the table with his ponderous
fist.</p>

<p>“You mean that he must be kidnapped?” he exclaimed.
“You think we may put it over better
on land than we did on the water?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s rather an ugly word,” warned Fleming,
looking around to see that they were not
overheard, “and perhaps it would be better not
to use it. What I mean is that in some way he
must be kept from taking the train late Friday
night or the early train Saturday morning. After
that it doesn’t matter what he does.</p>

<p>“You see,” he went on, “there wouldn’t be any
come-back in a thing like that. There’d be no
need to hurt him. The whole thing would only
cover about twelve hours. After nine o’clock on
Saturday morning he could be set at liberty and
be free as air. But he’d be in Boston and he
couldn’t possibly get a train then that would land
him in New York in time for the game.”</p>

<p>“It might work,” reflected Connelly. “It’s
worth trying, anyhow, unless we think of something
better. But it’s going to take a good deal
of neat work to carry it through.”</p>

<p>“It will,” admitted Fleming. “And it’s going
to be all the harder because he’ll probably be on
his guard after what nearly happened to him the
other night. But I think it can be done. The first
thing is to get the services of half a dozen men
that can be trusted to do just as they are told. Do
you know of such a bunch that you can lay your
hands on?”</p>

<p>“Moriarity does,” replied Connelly, referring
to the henchman whom Fleming had been introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to on the occasion of his first meeting with
Connelly. “He knows the tough side of Boston
like a book. He could get us just the gang we
need in less than no time.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” commented Fleming. “I’d get
him busy at once.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” confirmed Connelly. “And now
let’s get down to the fine points. We don’t want
to have any slip up this time.”</p>

<p>What followed was almost in whispers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>A RANDOM CLUE</small></h2>


<p>Mr. Beckworth Fleming would, no doubt,
have been interested in knowing that while he was
speaking of Joe in Boston the latter was discussing
him in New York.</p>

<p>It was Reggie who had first brought in his
name, as he stood with Joe and Jim in the lobby
of the Marlborough, waiting for the others of the
party to come down on the way to the train.</p>

<p>“Funny thing happened to-day, don’t you
know,” he remarked. “Fellow sitting in the box
next to me at the grounds got to talking about an
auto accident that happened on Long Island a little
while ago.”</p>

<p>Joe and Jim pricked up their ears.</p>

<p>“What did he say about it?” Joe asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, I heard him say that it was the wildest
ride he had ever had, and that he’d been wondering
ever since how they got through it without getting
pinched. Said that half the time the car was
going on two wheels. Once they knocked down a
man on the Merrick road, and they had come near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to smashing up a car they passed just before
that.”</p>

<p>“That describes the accident to Anderson,”
broke in Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, and don’t you remember how near they
came to running into us just before that?” added
Joe. “But did you get any clue as to who the fellows
were?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear any full names,” replied Reggie,
“but several times the man who was telling the
story referred to the reckless driving of ‘old
Beck,’ whoever that might have been.”</p>

<p>“Beck, Beck,” mused Jim. “That isn’t much of
a hint. The directory is full of Becks.”</p>

<p>A thought suddenly came to Joe.</p>

<p>“Fleming’s first name is Beckworth, isn’t it?”
he asked Reggie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Reggie.</p>

<p>“And wouldn’t it be natural for his cronies to
speak of him as Beck?” Joe went on.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Reggie. “As a matter of fact,
I’ve often heard them refer to him in that
way.”</p>

<p>“And he’s known as a reckless driver, isn’t he?”
asked Joe, going back in memory to the way in
which Fleming had handled the car on that memorable
afternoon when he had rescued Mabel from
his clutches.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Reggie responded. “In fact, he seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to take a sort of pride in it. I’ve often heard him
tell how often he had been arrested for speeding.”</p>

<p>“It begins to look as though he might have
been mixed up in that Anderson affair,” mused
Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s a mighty slender basis to go
on,” answered Joe. “Of course he’d deny it, and
we couldn’t prove it if we had nothing to back it
up with.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Reggie. “Now that you
come to speak of it, I remember catching sight of
Fleming at the Long Beach Hotel when we were
dining there. He was sitting at a table in the further
corner of the room. I thought of going over
to speak to him, but I noticed that he was with a
pretty noisy party, and as the girls were with us
I passed it up.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, that’s something more like proof!”
exclaimed Joe, with animation. “That brings him
near the scene of the accident on the day it happened.
He’s a reckless driver and his pals often
spoke of him as ‘old Beck.’ I believe he was the
fellow that knocked the old man down.”</p>

<p>“It looks like it,” agreed Jim, “and from what
we’ve learned of the fellow since, I think he’s just
the kind that would go on without trying to help
or stopping to see what he had done. But even
now we haven’t anything that would convince a
jury.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” agreed Reggie. “Moral proof isn’t
legal proof by a long shot. The one thing we need
to clinch the matter is the number of the car that
held the party.”</p>

<p>“What a pity we didn’t get it,” fumed Joe.</p>

<p>“We weren’t to blame for that,” replied Reggie.
“They were going so fast and raising such a cloud
of dust that we couldn’t see it. That is, we didn’t
get it in full. Seems to me, though, that I heard
you say something, Joe, about some numbers that
you caught sight of.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” confirmed Jim. “What were they,
Joe? Do you remember?”</p>

<p>“There was a seven and a four,” answered Joe.
“But I couldn’t be sure that they were next to each
other. There may have been another figure in
between. And anyway, as there were probably
five or six figures in the whole number, that isn’t
very much to go on.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” cried Jim, eagerly. “Every
car is registered in the State Registry Bureau, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Reggie. “Mine is, I know.
They put down the name of the man when they
give him his number.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” returned Jim. “What’s the matter
then with our making inquiries at the proper department
and finding the number of the car that is
registered as owned by Beckworth Fleming?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“The very thing,” assented Reggie. “But when
we find it, what then?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, perhaps,” Jim admitted. “And then,
on the other hand, it may mean a great deal. Suppose,
for instance, the number has a seven and a
four in it?”</p>

<p>“That would certainly bring it much closer to
Fleming,” observed Joe, thoughtfully, “and it
would make us that much surer in our own minds
that he’s the man in question. But it would still
fall far short of legal proof.”</p>

<p>“Bother legal proof!” snapped Jim. “The one
point is that all these things taken together would
make us feel so sure that we were on the right
track that we’d feel justified in accusing Fleming
to his face of having done it.”</p>

<p>“I see!” exclaimed Joe, his eyes kindling. “You
mean to put up a great big bluff and try to catch
him off his guard.”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” agreed Jim. “Trust to his
guilty conscience. He knows whether he did it or
not, and he won’t be sure how much we know. If
we act as if we were sure we have him dead to
rights, he may give himself away. Try to explain
or excuse it and in that way admit it. At any rate,
it seems to me it might be worth trying. We can’t
lose and we may win.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Reggie. “I believe it
might work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a dandy idea,” approved Joe, warmly.</p>

<p>“It would do me a whole lot of good to make
him come across handsomely to Anderson,” said
Jim. “The old man needs money badly, and Fleming
has a good deal more than is good for him.
And he can consider himself mighty lucky if he
gets off with only a money payment.”</p>

<p>“Well, whatever we do in that line, we’ll have
to do right away,” remarked Joe. “To-morrow’s
the last day we’ll be in Boston, and I’d like to fix
up the matter at once. Anderson we know is there
and Fleming probably will be, too.”</p>

<p>“I wish we’d known of this earlier,” remarked
Jim. “Of course all the official departments are
closed by this time.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Joe, “but I’ll tell you what we’ll do.
We’ll ask Belden here at the desk to look up the
matter for us the first thing to-morrow morning.
He can find out the number and call me up on the
long distance ’phone to Boston. We ought to
know all about it as early as ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“The very thing,” said Jim.</p>

<p>Joe went over to the hotel desk, where Belden,
the night clerk, had just come on duty. He was a
warm admirer of Baseball Joe, and, like everybody
in New York just then, was happy to do anything
he could for the famous pitcher of the Giants.</p>

<p>“Mr. Belden,” Joe began, “I want to ask a
favor of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Only too glad, Mr. Matson,” replied the clerk,
his face wreathed in smiles. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“I’d like you to call up the city office of the
State Registry Bureau, Broadway and Seventy-fourth
Street, early in the morning,” said Joe,
“and find out the number of the car owned by a
Mr. Beckworth Fleming. Then I’d like to have
you call me up on the long distance ’phone, of
course at my expense, and let me know what it is.
If you’ll do this for me I’ll be greatly obliged.”</p>

<p>The clerk made a note of the name and also of
the hotel where Joe would stay in Boston.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it without fail, Mr. Matson. You can
depend upon me.”</p>

<p>Joe thanked him and returned to his party,
which had now been joined by Mr. and Mrs. Matson
and the girls. A couple of taxicabs were
pressed into service, and they were carried to the
Grand Central Terminal where they embarked on
the last trip that was to be made to Boston during
the Series.</p>

<p>“What with the game to-morrow and perhaps
this Fleming matter on our program, I imagine
we’re going to have our hands full,” Jim remarked
in an aside to his friend.</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Joe, “it looks like a busy day.”</p>

<p>But just how busy a day it was destined to be
it would have startled him to learn.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>A BLUFF THAT WORKED</small></h2>


<p>Every member of Baseball Joe’s little party
had by this time become thoroughly acquainted
with every other, and they formed a very congenial
group.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Matson, as Joe had predicted
when he had sent on for them to come, were having
the time of their lives. The great world had
opened up its treasures for them after the long
years they had spent in their quiet village, and
they were enjoying it to the full. And their delight
in the new vista opened up was, of course,
immeasurably increased by their pride in Joe and
his achievements so far in the World Series.</p>

<p>Mabel, too, had taken them right into her heart
and had won their affection from the start. They
could easily see how things stood with her and
Joe and were eagerly ready to welcome her into a
closer relation.</p>

<p>Reggie was full of life and good-nature, and his
knowledge of city life made him invaluable as a
guide and companion. As for Clara, she was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
a perpetual flutter of happiness. Was she not with
her idolized brother? Was she not tasting the
delights of a broader life that she had often read
of and longed for but scarcely dreamed of seeing?
And had not that handsome Mr. Barclay shown
himself a devoted and perfect cavalier? Could
any girl barely out of her teens possibly ask for
more?</p>

<p>So it was a happy party that laughed and
chatted as the train sped through the night toward
Boston.</p>

<p>“Our last trip to Boston, for a while at least,”
smiled Mabel.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether the Series will be settled
there or at the Polo Grounds,” remarked Clara.
“It would be glorious if when we come back to-morrow
night the Giants should have won the
Series.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have two chances to the Bostons’
one, anyway,” observed Jim. “They <em>must</em> win
to-morrow or they’re goners. We can lose to-morrow
and still have a chance.”</p>

<p>“A chance!” objected Clara. “You ought to
say a certainty.”</p>

<p>“I’ve learned already that there’s nothing certain
in baseball,” laughed Jim.</p>

<p>“But Joe will be pitching that last game,” returned
Clara, as though that settled the question.</p>

<p>Joe laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish I could make the Red Sox feel as sure
of that as you do, Sis. If they did, they’d quit
right at the start.”</p>

<p>“Well, they might as well, anyway,” declared
Clara, with assured conviction.</p>

<p>“What is this I see in the paper about a tour
of the world after the Series is over?” asked Mr.
Matson.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s nothing very definite as yet,”
answered Joe. “McRae has been giving some
thought to the matter, I believe. If we win the
Series, we could go with the prestige of being the
champions of the world, which would be a big advertisement.
Mac could easily get up another
team composed of crack players which could be
called the All National or the All America Nine.
Then the two teams could travel together and give
exhibition games in most of the big cities of the
world.”</p>

<p>“Would there be much money in it?” asked Reggie.</p>

<p>“Oh, probably not so much, after all the expenses
were taken out,” Joe answered. “Possibly
there might be a thousand dollars for each player.
Some of the trips have panned out as much
as that.”</p>

<p>“Then this isn’t entirely a new idea,” remarked
Joe’s father.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” replied his son. “It’s been done before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
The boys have always drawn big crowds
and aroused a good deal of interest.”</p>

<p>“And they’d do that to-day more than ever,”
put in Jim. “Baseball is no longer simply an
American game but a world game. You’ll find
crack teams even in Japan and China.”</p>

<p>“It would be a wonderful experience,” remarked
Reggie.</p>

<p>“You bet it would!” exclaimed Joe, enthusiastically.
“Think of playing ball in sight of the
Pyramids! We’d take in all the great cities of
Asia and Europe and some in Africa. It would
be a liberal education. And instead of spending
money in making a tour of the world, we’d be paid
for taking it.”</p>

<p>“Rather soft, I call it,” laughed Jim.</p>

<p>“How long would the party be gone?” asked
gentle Mrs. Matson, who was somewhat alarmed
by the prospect of her boy being separated from
her by the width of the globe.</p>

<p>“Oh, not more than five months or so,” Joe replied.
“The boys couldn’t very well get started
much before the first of November, and they’d
have to be back for spring training.”</p>

<p>“They won’t need much training, I imagine,”
remarked Jim. “They’ll have been playing while
the other fellows have been loafing. They ought
to be in first class shape to begin the season.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” observed Joe; “it isn’t a dead sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
thing that we’ll go, even if we win the Series. And
if we lose, it’s dollars to doughnuts that Mac will
call the whole thing off.”</p>

<p>It was getting rather late, and Joe and Jim said
good-night to the others and sought their berths.</p>

<p>They were up and abroad earlier than usual
the next morning, for the matter of the automobile
accident promised to engross all the time they
could spare from the game.</p>

<p>Reggie was able to find out for them the place
at which Fleming was putting up in Boston. Having
ascertained from the clerk that he was still
staying there, the next thing was to get hold of
Louis Anderson.</p>

<p>Jim hurried up to the address the old man had
given them. It was in a humble neighborhood,
but the three rooms in which Anderson and his
wife were living were neat and clean.</p>

<p>Jim did not want to raise false hopes, in the
light of the imperfect information he had. So he
told Anderson that he thought he had a clue,
though he was not at all sure, as to the men who
had run him down.</p>

<p>“Do you think you would be able to recognize
the man who was driving, if you should see him?”
Jim inquired.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I could,” answered Anderson. “He
was on the side nearest me and I got a good look
at his face just as the car bore down on me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s good,” replied Jim. “Now if you’ll
get ready and jump in with me, we’ll go down to
where Mr. Matson is.”</p>

<p>The old man complied eagerly, and they were
soon on their way down town.</p>

<p>Joe, in the meantime, had hovered in the vicinity
of the telephone, waiting impatiently for the long
distance call.</p>

<p>Shortly after nine o’clock it came.</p>

<p>“Is this Mr. Matson?” the voice inquired.
“Good morning, Mr. Matson. This is Belden
talking. I called up just now at the registry office
and found that the number of Mr. Beckworth
Fleming’s car is 36754. Did you get that?
3-6-7-5-4. Yes, that’s it. Not at all, Mr. Matson.
Don’t mention it. Glad to be of service. Hope
you win to-day. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Joe stared at the number that he had jotted
down as Belden had called it off. 36754. There
were the two figures, 7 and 4, the 7 coming first
as he remembered.</p>

<p>It was not proof. But it was corroboration,
enough, anyway, to justify the audacious bluff that
he had in mind.</p>

<p>Jim returned shortly afterward with Louis Anderson,
who greeted Joe, gratefully.</p>

<p>“It’s an awful lot of trouble you two young men
are putting yourselves to for me,” he declared in
a grateful voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all right,” returned Joe. “It was a dastardly
thing that was done to you, and the man
who did it has got to pay for it if we can make
him. But you mustn’t build your hopes too high.
We’ve only probabilities to go on instead of certainties.”</p>

<p>They stepped into the taxicab which Jim had
retained, and were soon at the Albemarle where
Fleming was stopping.</p>

<p>“Suppose he refuses to receive us when the
clerk sends up your card,” asked Jim. “You can’t
very well force your way into his rooms.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t going to be any card,” replied Joe.
“Reggie gave me the number of his suite and we’ll
just go up in the elevator without being announced.”</p>

<p>“But he may slam the door in your face when
he sees who it is,” Jim remarked.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a pretty capable foot,” grinned Joe,
“and I guess I can keep the door from being shut.”</p>

<p>They got off at the fourth floor and walked
along the corridor till they reached the number
for which they were looking.</p>

<p>Fleming was already engaged with a visitor.
He and Big Connelly were in earnest conversation
when Joe rapped on the door. Fleming looked up
with some irritation at being interrupted.</p>

<p>“What does that clerk mean by not announcing
a caller?” he growled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll just step into the bedroom while you see
who it is,” said Connelly, tiptoeing into the adjoining
room.</p>

<p>Fleming went to the door and opened it. He
started back in surprise and alarm when he saw
Joe’s face. Then with a snarl he started to slam
the door, but Joe thrust his foot between the door
and the jamb. Then he gave a push with his
brawny shoulder and the next moment he and his
companions were in the room. Jim coolly shut the
door and stood with his back to it.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” shouted Fleming, almost
stuttering with rage. “Get out of here this
minute or I’ll have you thrown out.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t,” replied Joe, coolly. “I’ve got
a little business with you, Fleming, and I don’t
go out till it’s finished.”</p>

<p>Before the cold gleam in his eye, Fleming shrank
back.</p>

<p>“If you attempt any violence&mdash;&mdash;” he began in
a voice that trembled.</p>

<p>“There isn’t going to be any violence unless you
make it necessary,” Joe interrupted. “Though I
ought to give you another thrashing for that trap
you laid for me the other night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” growled Fleming,
sullenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you do. But we’ll let that go. I came
here this morning to tell you that we’ve identified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
you as the driver of the car that ran this man down
on the Merrick Road and then went on without
stopping to see how badly he was hurt.”</p>

<p>The accusation was so sudden, so positive, so direct,
that, as Joe had hoped, it took Fleming fairly
off his feet. He stood staring wildly at the group,
his face an image of guilt. Then he tried to rally.</p>

<p>“It’s false!” he shouted. “I didn’t do anything
of the kind.”</p>

<p>“No use of lying, Fleming,” said Joe, coldly.
“We’ve got the goods on you.”</p>

<p>“He’s the man!” cried Louis Anderson, excitedly.
“He had a cap on then, and his face was
red, as though he was drunk, but he’s the same
man. I could swear to him.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy,” snarled Fleming. “I wasn’t on
Long Island that day.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have dinner at the Long Beach
Hotel that day, eh?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“N-no,” Fleming denied, avoiding Joe’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, you did,” declared Joe, sternly. “And
afterward you nearly crashed into the machine I
was in. I saw you hit this man. I looked for the
number on your car. The number of that car is
36754. Ever heard those figures before, Fleming?”</p>

<p>His eyes were like cold steel now and seemed to
be boring Fleming through and through. He
seemed so sure of his facts, so unwavering and relentless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that Fleming crumpled up. The arrow
shot at a venture had reached its mark.</p>

<p>“It was the old fool’s own fault,” he growled,
casting aside all further pretence of denial. “If
he hadn’t run in front of the machine he wouldn’t
have got hurt.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t so,” cried Anderson. “You were
swerving all over the road. Your crowd was
shouting and singing. You didn’t blow your horn.
You were half drunk. And after you hit me you
didn’t stop.”</p>

<p>“We’re his witnesses,” said Joe. “And I don’t
think he’d have any trouble in getting heavy damages
from a jury.”</p>

<p>“Let him try it,” snarled Fleming. “I’ve got
more money than he has and I’ll fight the case
through every court. He’ll die of old age before
he ever gets a cent from me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so,” remarked Joe, carelessly.
“I don’t suppose you’d care to go to jail
now, would you, Fleming?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a question of jail,” replied Fleming.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes it is,” rejoined Joe. “You may not
know that a law has been passed making it a prison
offense in New York State to run away after
knocking a man down with an auto and not stop
to see what you can do for him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” said Fleming, going white.</p>

<p>“I know what I’m talking about,” answered Joe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
in a voice that carried conviction. “You’d better
come to your senses, Fleming. We’ve got you
dead to rights. You ran this man down. You’ve
admitted it. You ran away without stopping.
Half a dozen of us saw you do it. Nothing can
save you from going behind the bars if the matter
is pressed. You’ll do the right thing by this
man, or I’ll see that you’re arrested the minute you
set foot in New York.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by the square thing?” asked
Fleming, who now was thoroughly wilted.</p>

<p>“We’re not unreasonable,” said Joe. “You
came within an ace of killing this man. He had
to go to a hospital. At his age he’ll feel the effect
of the shock as long as he lives. It will probably
shorten his life. A jury under those circumstances
would certainly give him several thousand
dollars. I think you ought to give him at least
two thousand. Will that be satisfactory, Mr. Anderson?”</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>Fleming reflected a moment. Then he nodded
surlily.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“And do it to-day, if you please,” Joe went on
smoothly. “I want to know that this thing is
settled before I go back to New York. Write
down your address, Mr. Anderson, and Mr. Fleming
or his lawyer will be up to see you before night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
And I’ll run up myself before I leave, to see
whether it has been done.”</p>

<p>There was a threat in the last words that
warned Fleming against any attempt at evasion or
delay. The latter agreed with a nod of his head.</p>

<p>There was no pretence of a farewell that would
have been mere hypocrisy under the circumstances,
and without a word Baseball Joe’s party left the
room, while Fleming stared after them with baffled
rage and hate in his eyes.</p>

<p>Once more in the taxicab, Anderson broke out
with a flood of thanks that Joe waved aside
lightly.</p>

<p>They drove around by way of his humble home
and left him there, and then went hurriedly down
to their hotel.</p>

<p>Left to themselves in the car, Jim and Joe
looked for a long time steadily at each other.
Then Jim burst out into a roar.</p>

<p>Joe grinned happily.</p>

<p>“Joe,” cried Jim when his paroxysms had subsided,
“as a bluffer you’re a wonder, a real wonder!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>STEALING SIGNALS</small></h2>


<p>Fleming sat in his chair, limp and sprawling,
after the departure of the trio who had burst in
on him so unexpectedly. So swept and exhausted
was he by the tide of emotions aroused by their
visit that he had forgotten all about the presence
of Connelly in the adjoining room, and only became
conscious of it when the fellow plumped himself
down in the chair beside him.</p>

<p>“Some stormy session,” he remarked, as he
lighted a fat, black cigar.</p>

<p>Fleming only growled in reply.</p>

<p>“Don’t wonder that you feel sore,” Connelly
commented. “They certainly put the skids under
you in great shape. That Matson is a bird and
no mistake.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get even with him yet,” Fleming broke out
stormily. “I won’t let him crow over me. I won’t
pay that money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will,” returned Connelly, calmly.
“He’s got you where the hair is short in that matter
of the jail. It mightn’t have been so bad if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
you’d kept your nerve and denied everything. But
he got you so rattled that you admitted knocking
that fellow down and then the gravy was spilled.”</p>

<p>“What was the use of keeping it up?” queried
Fleming. “He had the facts.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he did,” admitted Connelly, doubtfully,
“and then again he may have had only some half
facts and made a bluff at the rest. He’s got nerve
enough to do it. I have to hand it to him. But
now you have admitted it, you’ll have to pony up.
What’s a couple of thousand to you, anyway?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t so much the money,” Fleming muttered
gloomily. “It’s knowing that he got it out of me
and is probably laughing at me this minute.”</p>

<p>“Let him laugh,” said Connelly, with the philosophy
that it is so easy to use where others are concerned.
“We’ll have our laugh later on. But
you want to get that money paid right away, because
if we put over on Matson what we’re planning,
he’ll be so furious that he’ll send you to
jail sure. But if the thing is settled, he’ll be helpless.</p>

<p>“Another thing, unless I’m very much mistaken,
Matson himself has given us a mighty valuable tip.
He’s put a spoke in his own wheel.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Fleming.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear him say that he was going
to run up to-night to that old man’s house to see
whether you’d come across or not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, where could we have a better chance for
pulling off our little game? It’s probably a poor
neighborhood with the lights none too good and
where a scrap wouldn’t attract much attention because
it’s a common thing. Moriarity and his
bunch could be on hand and the rest would be as
easy as taking a dead mouse from a blind kitten.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, the very thing!” ejaculated Fleming,
a look of malevolent delight coming into his face.</p>

<p>“Sure it is,” chuckled Connelly. “I’ll get word
to Moriarity at once. In the meantime, you’d
better settle. Take in all you can of the neighborhood
while you’re doing it.”</p>

<p>“Even if Markwith wins this afternoon and so
ends the Series, I’d like to put this through on Matson
just the same,” snarled Fleming, viciously.</p>

<p>“No we won’t,” declared Connelly, decidedly.
“I’m out to keep him from winning the Series and
nothing else. If Markwith wins, the game’s up,
anyway, and the thing ends for me right there.
But if he loses I’ve got a chance, and I’ll see that
Matson doesn’t pitch the last game.”</p>

<p>All Boston seemed to have turned out that
afternoon at Braves Field. The enormous seating
accommodations were taxed to capacity. It
was the last chance the loyal Bostonians would
have to see their favorites in action. And the
fact that if they lost to-day their chance for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
world’s pennant was gone brought the excitement
to a delirious pitch.</p>

<p>Landers was in the box for the Bostons while
Markwith twirled for the Giants. Before the
game had gone three innings it was seen that both
these gladiators were out to do or die. There was
an unusual number of strike outs and the bases
were occupied only at infrequent intervals. Up
to the fifth it was little more than a pitcher’s duel.
But after that, though Landers kept his effectiveness,
the Red Sox began to get to Markwith more
frequently. It was not that the latter seemed to
have let down a particle. His speed and his curves
were working beautifully, but in a way almost
uncanny the Bostons seemed to know what kind
of ball was coming next and set themselves for it
accordingly.</p>

<p>In the sixth they gathered two runs. Burkett
had clouted out a home run for the Giants in
their half, but that left them still one short of a
tie.</p>

<p>Boston started the seventh with a rattling two-bagger
to center.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it,” muttered McRae, uneasily.
“Markwith never seemed to be in better
shape. He’s got a world of smoke.”</p>

<p>“They seem to know just what he’s going to
feed them,” commented Robson. “It almost
looks&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>He was interrupted by a sharp exclamation
from Joe.</p>

<p>“Look over there by the Boston dugout!” he
exclaimed excitedly. “There’s Hartley just behind
the screen whispering to Banks. I’ll bet that
skunk is giving away Markwith’s signals!”</p>

<p>They looked in the direction indicated. Banks,
the Boston second string pitcher, was lolling carelessly
against the railing of the grandstand, idly
chewing on a wisp of straw. Hartley’s face behind
the screen was not two feet away from Banks’
ear.</p>

<p>As Markwith prepared to wind up for the next
pitch, Hartley leaned forward a trifle and his lips
moved. A glance and an almost imperceptible
sign passed between Banks and the man at the
plate. Then as a low incurve came sweeping up,
the batsman caught it square on the seam for a
line single to left.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried McRae, leaping up from
the bench. “They’re stealing our signals!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>A BLOW IN THE DARK</small></h2>


<p>McRae rushed over to the umpire.</p>

<p>“There’s a fellow over there in the grandstand
giving away our signs,” he stormed.</p>

<p>Cries of derision came from the stands.</p>

<p>“Hire a hall!”</p>

<p>“Write him a letter!”</p>

<p>“Play ball!”</p>

<p>The umpire called time and walked over with
McRae to where Banks was standing.</p>

<p>“Get away from there,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Banks, impudently.</p>

<p>“Never mind why. Get away I tell you.”</p>

<p>There was nothing left but to obey and Banks
sauntered off.</p>

<p>“And as for you,” said the umpire, addressing
Hartley, “if I see you talking to any of the players
I’ll have you put out of the park.”</p>

<p>“You’re a disgrace to the National League,”
cried McRae, glaring at Hartley, “and I’ll see that
you get all that’s coming to you for this bit of
work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aw, what’s eating you?” retorted “Bugs” sullenly.
“I wasn’t doing anything.” But he seemed
to shrivel up before the rage in his former manager’s
eyes, and for the rest of the game obeyed the
umpire’s injunction.</p>

<p>Markwith and Mylert, who was catching him,
instantly changed their signs and the Bostons
scored no more. But the damage was already
done, for Landers was doing some demon pitching,
and the game ended with the score two to one
in favor of the Red Sox.</p>

<p>It was a hard game to lose, and Markwith received
nothing but condolence and sympathy from
his mates. He had pitched superbly and though
beaten was not disgraced.</p>

<p>“I wonder how much that traitor got for giving
away his own league,” said Joe, bitterly.</p>

<p>“Probably just enough to fill up his wretched
skin with booze,” returned Jim. “Fellows like him
come cheap.”</p>

<p>“He won’t get another chance,” put in McRae,
angrily. “I’ll have the stands searched to-morrow,
and if he’s there he’ll be bundled out neck
and heels.”</p>

<p>Once more the hard-won lead of the Giants had
vanished into thin air. But they took heart of
hope and braced up for the struggle on the morrow.
They were to play on their own grounds and
Joe would be in the box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>All the members of Joe’s party were boiling
over with indignation. If anything they took the
defeat harder than the players themselves, who
had learned in a hard school to take what was
coming to them and brace up for revenge.</p>

<p>“Well, to-morrow’s a new day and what we’ll
do to those fellows then will be a caution,” Jim
declared philosophically.</p>

<p>Perhaps his cheerful view of things was increased
by the fact that Clara had promised to let
him take her for a cozy little spin to see Bunker
Hill Monument by moonlight. The moon just
then was in high favor with these two young people.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the pair need not come
back to the hotel, but that Jim could bring Clara
directly to the train. Mr. Matson and Reggie
would escort the others.</p>

<p>Joe grudged every minute spent away from
Mabel and stayed with her as long as he could that
evening. But he had promised to drop in on Louis
Anderson to see that the arrangement with Fleming
had been carried out, and at last he left her
reluctantly, promising to see her again on the train
if only long enough to say good-night.</p>

<p>But though he was deprived of her physical
presence, his thoughts were full of her as he was
whisked away in the car he had summoned, and
the time passed so quickly that he was surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
when the driver drew up in front of Anderson’s
house.</p>

<p>“Wait for me here,” he directed as he stepped
out. “I’ll only be a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” was the response.</p>

<p>Hardly had Joe gone inside when a man stepped
up to the curb.</p>

<p>“I want you to take me to the North Station,”
he said, preparing to step inside.</p>

<p>“Sorry, sir,” was the answer, “but I’m waiting
for the fare I brought here.”</p>

<p>“But I must get that train, I tell you,” persisted
the other. “I’ll pay you anything you want. Ten
dollars, fifteen even.”</p>

<p>The driver was tempted.</p>

<p>“Make it twenty and I’ll go,” he said. “I suppose
the gentleman can pick up another car.”</p>

<p>“Sure he can,” replied the other. “Twenty it
is. Get a move on, now.”</p>

<p>He got inside and the car whizzed away.</p>

<p>Joe found Anderson and his wife radiant.</p>

<p>“He did it, Mr. Matson!” the old man cried.
“He grumbled a lot about having had to telegraph
on to New York to have his bank wire the cash
to him, but he did it. And I signed a paper giving
him a release of all claims against him. Oh, Mr.
Matson, we can never thank you enough for what
you have done for us.”</p>

<p>His wife joined in his expressions of gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” smiled Joe. “I only did
what any decent man would do to right a great
wrong. And you squared the account when you
gave me that warning the other day. I was just
on the point of stepping into a trap when I thought
of the warning and it saved me.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” cried Anderson, delightedly.
“I’m mighty glad if it helped you.”</p>

<p>They chatted happily for a few minutes and
then, as his time was getting short, Joe took his
leave with their repeated thanks ringing in his
ears.</p>

<p>He was dumbfounded when he saw that the
taxicab was not there.</p>

<p>“Where in thunder is that fellow?” he asked
himself. “I suppose he’s getting a nip in the nearest
saloon.”</p>

<p>But when, after a minute or two spent in waiting,
no car appeared, Joe started for the nearest
thoroughfare, three short blocks away.</p>

<p>He was just passing the second corner when a
man stepped out of the shadows with something
in his hand.</p>

<p>“Hi, there, stop!”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” demanded Joe, trying
to make out the face in the darkness.</p>

<p>“I want you!” hissed the man.</p>

<p>He took a step closer and raised the object he
carried in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe tried to dodge, but it was too late.</p>

<p>There was a quick blow. Joe felt no sense of
pain. Rather it was a gradual sinking, sinking,
ten thousand fathoms deep!</p>

<p>Then the famous young baseball player became
unconscious.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>QUICK WORK</small></h2>


<p>Joe’s father and mother, together with Mabel
and Reggie, had reached the station a few minutes
before train time, and Clara and Jim, who
might be excused for tarrying, had joined them
a little later. They were somewhat puzzled at
not finding Joe on the platform.</p>

<p>“You folks get on anyway,” suggested Jim.
“Probably Joe is up in the car with the team.
McRae may have nabbed him to have a talk with
him.”</p>

<p>After they were safely in their coach, Jim hurried
forward to the Giants’ cars. He went
through both of them, but before he had finished
his search the gong rang and the train started.</p>

<p>“Seen anything of Joe?” he asked McRae.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer. “I suppose he’s in the
car behind with his folks.”</p>

<p>“But he isn’t,” replied Jim. “I thought I’d find
him here.”</p>

<p>“What?” fairly yelled McRae, springing to his
feet. “You don’t mean to say he’s missed the
train?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>In an instant all was agitation.</p>

<p>The smoker was first searched, then every car
in the train from end to end, but, of course, Joe
was not to be found.</p>

<p>McRae and Robson were wild and the rest of
the team were glum.</p>

<p>“Of course, he can get that eight o’clock train
in the morning,” was the only comfort McRae
would allow himself. “That will get him to the
grounds in time, but he won’t be in good shape to
pitch right after the trip.”</p>

<p>But Jim had reasons of his own for fear, and
a cold sweat broke out on him as he thought of
Fleming. But he put on as good a face as possible
in order to reassure the girls and the rest of
Joe’s party, who were torn with anxiety and apprehension.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when Joe woke to a
sense of his surroundings. His head swam and
it was some time before he could recall the events
of the preceding night.</p>

<p>He was in a shabby room, sitting on the floor
against the wall with his hands tied behind him.
As his brain cleared he was conscious of a face
looking at him curiously. There was a sweet
sickly odor in the room.</p>

<p>“Waking up, eh?” asked Moriarty with a grin.</p>

<p>“You’ll pay for this,” said Joe, thickly.</p>

<p>Moriarty laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now don’t get sore,” he counseled. “Nobody’s
going to hurt you. You’ll be out of this in
a little while now. We’re going to let you go just
as soon as the New York train has gone.”</p>

<p>Joe tried to digest this. Why should they keep
him from getting the train for New York. Then
in a blinding flash his brain woke from its daze.</p>

<p>It was the day of the last game! And he was
in Boston! And if he missed the morning train
he could not get to New York before the game
was over!</p>

<p>His heart turned sick. What would McRae
and the rest of the boys say? What would Mabel
and the folks think?</p>

<p>He pictured the consternation when he should
fail to turn up in time. The team would be demoralized.
Whom would they pitch? Only Jim
was available and he had pitched two days before.
And he would be so full of worry over his friend
that he could not be at his best.</p>

<p>Was the World Series then to be lost? Was
the splendid fight the boys had put up to go for
nothing?</p>

<p>“You only got a little tap on the head,” Moriarty
was saying. “It was just enough to make
you quiet, and chloroform did the rest. We didn’t
figure to be any rougher than we had to be.”</p>

<p>Joe made no reply but he was thinking hard
and fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>He tested the bonds that held his hands behind
him. They seemed tight but not excessively so.
Probably his captors had put most of their faith
in the chloroform.</p>

<p>With as little apparent exertion as possible, he
began to stretch and strain at them. His powerful
wrists and hands seemed endowed with double
their ordinary strength and to his delight he could
feel the cords give.</p>

<p>Moriarty was alone with him, but Joe could
hear low voices in an adjoining room. One of
them he thought he recognized as Fleming’s, and
his teeth gritted with rage.</p>

<p>At last he wriggled one hand free, although he
had rasped his wrist till he felt it was bleeding.
A moment more and he had freed his other hand,
though he still kept both behind him.</p>

<p>Moriarty was yawning after his night’s vigil.</p>

<p>“What time is it now?” Joe muttered sleepily.</p>

<p>“Just a little after eight,” Moriarty answered.
“The train’s just about started now, but we’ll let
you cool your heels here for another hour or so.
Then you can walk the ties if you want to.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got me pretty well trussed up here,”
said Joe. “The fellow who tied these knots knew
his business.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Moriarty, complacently, strolling
over to look at them. “He’s a dandy when it
comes to doing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>But he got no further.</p>

<p>As he bent down, Joe’s muscular hands darted
out and clutched him by the throat. The yell he
started to give was stifled at its birth. In a moment
Joe was on top of him with his knee on his
chest.</p>

<p>Moriarty struggled as hard as he could, but his
liquor-soaked frame speedily collapsed before
Joe’s onslaught, and in a moment he lay limp and
senseless. Then Joe flung him aside and rose to
his feet.</p>

<p>He rubbed his legs vigorously to restore the circulation
until he felt the strength coming back
into them.</p>

<p>There was but one door leading from the room.
Joe went to it on tiptoe. He could still hear the
murmur of voices. He flung the door open suddenly
and burst into the adjoining room.</p>

<p>Fleming and Connelly sprang to their feet in
consternation. With a powerful uppercut, Joe
sent Fleming crashing to the floor. Connelly retreated
and Joe had no time to bother with him.</p>

<p>He flung himself down the stairs and out into
the street. Half a block away he saw a taxicab
coming toward him. He rushed toward it.</p>

<p>“To the South Station!” he gasped. “Quick!
Quick! Quick!”</p>

<p>In an amazingly short time, the taxicab, running
at high speed, landed him at the depot. Joe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
saw by the station clock that it was a quarter to
nine.</p>

<p>Frantically, he sought out the traffic manager
and ordered a special.</p>

<p>“I must be in New York by one o’clock,” he
cried. “I must, I tell you. Never mind the price.
Get me a special.”</p>

<p>The official hummed and hawed. “It would take
a little time to make it up, to get a car. It
would&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t wait for a car,” interrupted Joe, in
frenzy. “I’ll ride on the locomotive.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes the train despatcher had arranged
for the right of way, and one of the road’s
fastest locomotives puffed up. Joe sprang into the
cab, the engineer flung the throttle open and they
were off.</p>

<p>“Can you make it?” questioned our hero, anxiously.</p>

<p>“We’ll make it or bust,” was the grim response
of the engineer.</p>

<p>He was one of the oldest and most reliable men
on the road and as Joe looked at him he felt his
confidence rising.</p>

<p>Yet a good many miles lay between our hero
and New York City.</p>

<p>And a hundred things might happen to delay
the special.</p>

<p>On and on they went, humming over the steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
rails at such a rate of speed that Joe could scarcely
see the telegraph poles.</p>

<p>Suddenly the engineer pulled on a lever and
the big locomotive slackened speed so quickly that
our hero was all but thrown to the floor of the
cab.</p>

<p>“Wh&mdash;what’s the matter?” he gasped, when
he could catch his breath.</p>

<p>“Signal against us,” was the short reply. “It’s
O. K. now;” and once more the locomotive sped
on its way.</p>

<p>“Phew! you have to have your eyes open, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“That’s it&mdash;just like you do, when you are
pitching,” answered the old engineer.</p>

<p>“Some work, running a locomotive,” mused the
young baseball player. “I guess an engineer
earns all the money he gets.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later came another scare. Again
the locomotive pulled up, this time to allow an
automobile full of people to pass over the tracks.
An instant sooner and the big engine would have
ground the “joy riders” to death.</p>

<p>“Meet such fools almost every trip,” said the
engineer. “Seems as if they wanted to be killed.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you have gates at such crossings?”</p>

<p>“It would cost too much money to have a gate
at every crossing,” was the explanation. “We do
have ’em on the main roads. That was only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
little dirt road&mdash;I don’t know why the auto was
on it. I wasn’t looking for anything faster than
a farm wagon or a buggy.”</p>

<p>“You must have some accidents?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but not many, considering the risks we
run. But we wouldn’t have hardly any accidents
if the folks were a bit more careful. But some
of ’em don’t heed the warnings. They will read
a ‘Safety First’ sign and then run right into danger,
just as if they were blind,” went on the old
engineer, with a grimace.</p>

<p>They were now on an upgrade, but presently
they gained the top of the rise and down they
streaked on the other side, at a rate of speed that
fairly took Joe’s breath away.</p>

<p>“Some running, and no mistake!” he gasped.
“You must be making a mile a minute, or better!”</p>

<p>“Running at the rate of seventy-five miles an
hour. But we can’t keep it up. Here is where
we slow down,” and they did so, as a long curve
appeared in the tracks.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I want to be a locomotive
engineer. You run too fast.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t want to be a baseball player&mdash;you
pitch too fast,” chuckled the old engineer.</p>

<p>“Well, everyone to his own calling, I suppose.”</p>

<p>On they plunged in the wildest ride Baseball
Joe had ever known. Under arches and over
bridges, thundering through towns with scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
a lessening of speed, past waiting trains drawn up
on side tracks to give the special the right of way,
on, on, lurching, swaying, tearing along, until at
ten minutes before one the panting engine drew
up in the yards at New York City.</p>

<p>The game was to begin at two.</p>

<p>Baseball Joe leaped into a taxicab with orders
to scorch up the pavements in a mad dash to the
Polo Grounds. Then the clubhouse, into which
Joe tumbled, covered with grime and cinders, amid
the frantic exclamations of the rubbers and attendants.
Then the cooling shower and a quick
shift into his uniform, after which Joe, cool, collected,
thoroughly master of himself, strolled out
on the field where the whole Giant team forgot
their practice and made a wild rush for him.</p>

<p>He had fought a good fight. He had kept the
faith.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>A GLORIOUS VICTORY</small></h2>


<p>There was a mad scramble and Joe was almost
pulled to pieces by his relieved and exulting mates.
Then came a torrent of questions which Joe good-naturedly
parried.</p>

<p>“After the game, boys, I’ll tell you all about
it,” he said, “but just now I want to get a little
practice in tossing them over.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you that nothing could stop that
boy from getting here?” crowed Robson, gleefully.</p>

<p>“I thought so myself,” answered McRae, “but
when they ’phoned up to me that he hadn’t come
in on that regular morning train, I thought our
goose was cooked.”</p>

<p>In some mysterious way, though McRae had
tried to keep it a profound secret, the news had
got abroad that something had occurred that
would keep Matson out of the game, and the
crowds that had put their chief reliance on that
mighty arm of his had been restless and fearful.
So when they recognized him the stands rocked
and thundered with applause, and the general relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
was not much less than that felt by the Giants
themselves at the return of their crack pitcher.</p>

<p>But it was toward an upper box that Joe’s eyes
first turned. There was a wild flutter of handkerchiefs
and clapping of hands. Mabel and Clara
were leaning far out and waving to him. But
Mrs. Matson’s face was hidden by her handkerchief,
and Joe saw his father quietly slip his arm
around her. Joe did not dare to look any longer
for he suddenly felt a dimness come over his own
eyes, and he hastily turned to the tremendous task
that confronted him.</p>

<p>For that afternoon he was fighting against odds.
His head was still aching from the effects of the
blow and the chloroform. The rocking of the
engine had made his legs unsteady. And the only
food he had had since the night before was a sandwich
he had sent for while he was slipping into
his uniform.</p>

<p>But it is just such circumstances that bring out
the thoroughbred strain in a man, and as Baseball
Joe took his place in the box and looked around
at the enormous crowd and realized the immense
responsibility that rested on him, he rose magnificently
to the occasion. Gone was weariness and
pain and weakness. His nerves stiffened to the
strain, and the game he pitched that afternoon was
destined to become a classic in baseball history.</p>

<p>The first ball he whipped over the plate went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
for a strike. A second and a third followed. And
from that time on Joe knew that he held the Bostons
in the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>There are times when to feel invincible is to be
invincible. Joe was in that mood. <a href="#image01">He was a
glorious figure of</a> athletic <a href="#image01">young manhood</a> as he
stood there with forty thousand pairs of eyes riveted
upon him. He had discarded his cap because
the band hurt his head where he had been struck,
and his brown hair gleamed in the bright sun as
he hurled the ball with deadly precision toward
the batter. Like a piston rod his arm shot out untiringly
and the ball whistled as it cut the plate.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, see that ball come over!” muttered
McRae.</p>

<p>“He’ll wear himself out,” said Robson, anxiously.
“It isn’t in flesh and blood to keep up that
gait for nine innings.”</p>

<p>Fraser was in the box for the Bostons, and he,
too, was pitching first-class ball. But the Giants
by the end of the fourth inning were beginning to
solve his delivery. The hits were getting a sharper
ring to them and going out more on a line. But
superb fielding helped the Bostonian out of several
tight places and he “got by” until the fifth.</p>

<p>Then the Giants broke the ice. Larry sent a
corking single out to center. Denton whaled out a
tremendous hit that had all the earmarks of a
home run. But Walters, by a wonderful sprint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
got under it and Larry, who had rounded second,
had all he could do to get back to first before the
throw in.</p>

<p>“Highway robbery,” growled Denton, as he
went disconsolately back to the bench.</p>

<p>Willis went out on strikes, but Becker poled out
a crashing three-bagger that brought Larry over
the rubber for the first run of the game and sent
the stands into hysterics.</p>

<p>Becker was caught napping a moment later and
the inning ended. The New Yorkers were hilarious
while the Boston rooters were correspondingly
depressed.</p>

<p>“You’re getting to him, boys!” yelled McRae.
“We’ll drive him to the tall timber before long.”</p>

<p>But Fraser had views of his own on that subject
and refused to be driven. He had no ambition
to be slaughtered to make a New York holiday.</p>

<p>Still, though he uncorked a dazzling assortment
of shoots and slants, the Giants scored another
run in the sixth though it took two singles, two
passes and a wild pitch before it was finally recorded.</p>

<p>Iredell beat out a slow roller to Hobbs and
took second on a single by Curry to right field.
Both of them were advanced a base on a wild pitch
that just touched the tips of Thompson’s fingers
as he leaped for it, and rolled all the way to the
Bostons’ dugout before it was regained. Joe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
purposely passed, Fraser thinking that with the
bases full a double play might pull him out of
danger.</p>

<p>Mylert hit to Hobbs, forcing Iredell at the
plate, although he made a great slide. Another
pass given to Burkett forced Curry home for the
second run of the game, leaving the bases still
full. Larry was at the bat and there was a great
chance to “clean up,” as he was frantically urged
to do by the excited spectators. But the best he
could do was to tap weakly to Fraser who fired
it back to the plate making a force out. Thompson,
in turn, shot it to Hobbs in plenty of time to
get the runner, making a sharp and snappy double
play.</p>

<p>“We ought to have made more out of that than
we did,” growled McRae. “That’s what I call
bush league work. To have the bases full twice
and as the result of it all one little measly run!”</p>

<p>“Never mind, John,” chuckled Robson. “It’s
one more to the good, anyway, and even if it is
measly I’ll bet that Boston would be mighty glad
to have one like it.”</p>

<p>In the seventh inning, Walters, the first man up,
sent up a high foul that Burkett and Mylert
started for at once. Larry, who was field captain,
shouted to Burkett to take the ball. But Mylert
either did not hear or trusted to his own judgment
and collided forcibly with the first baseman, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
going to the ground with a crash, while the ball
dropped between them.</p>

<p>The other players rushed to the spot and lifted
the players to their feet. Luckily, they were not
unconscious although badly shaken, but it was fully
five minutes before the game was resumed.</p>

<p>Walters’ second effort was a sharp grounder
straight at Denton, which the latter shot to first
in plenty of time. But the ball went high and
rolled almost to the right field wall. By the time
it was retrieved, Walters had got around to third
amid the frantic acclamations of the Boston rooters
who thought they saw at last a chance to
score.</p>

<p>With a man on third, no man out and some of
the heaviest sluggers coming up, it looked as
though the Red Sox would break their string of
zeros.</p>

<p>A long fly to the outfield, even though caught,
would in all probability bring in Walters from
third.</p>

<p>But Joe tightened up and struck out the next
man up in three pitched balls. He made Hobbs
chop a bounder to the box on which Walters did
not dare to try for the plate. Then with two out
he beguiled Girdner into sending up a towering
foul which Mylert caught almost without stirring
from his position. Poor Walters, left at third,
hurled his cap to the ground in a movement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
despair, and the gloom about the Boston section
of the stands could be fairly felt.</p>

<p>The Bostons now were growing desperate.
They bunted. They tried to wait Joe out. They
sought to rattle him by finding fault with his position
in the box. They put in pinch hitters. They
pulled all the “inside stuff” they knew.</p>

<p>But Joe obstinately refused to “crack.” He
“had everything” on the ball. His change of pace
was perfect. His curves worked beautifully. His
drop ball broke sharply, inches below their
bats.</p>

<p>“All over but the shouting,” chuckled McRae,
as the Red Sox came in for their last inning.</p>

<p>But two minutes later he was pale as chalk
while the Boston partisans were in delirium.</p>

<p>Girdner sent an easy grasser to Larry, who
booted it, and the batter reached first. Stock followed
with a bunt that Denton slipped down on as
he ran in for it. These mishaps must have got on
Burkett’s nerves, for he squarely muffed Thompson’s
pop fly that any “busher” could have
caught.</p>

<p>There were three men on bases, though none
had made a hit. No man was out, and Cooper,
the slugger of the Boston team, was coming to the
plate.</p>

<p>A hit of any kind would bring in two men and
tie the game. A two-bagger would clear the bases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and put Boston in the lead. The Red Sox rooters
were on their feet and screaming like mad.</p>

<p>Joe shot over a ball at which Cooper refused
to “bite.” The next one, however, suited him better,
and he sent it hurtling toward the box like a
bullet.</p>

<p>Joe saw it coming two feet over his head. Like
a flash he leaped up and caught it in his ungloved
hand. He turned and shot it over to Denton at
third. Denton touched the bag putting out Girdner
who had turned to go back and then got the
ball down to Larry before Stock could get back to
second.</p>

<p>It was a triple play! The game was over, the
Series was won and the Giants had become the
champions of the world!</p>

<p>For a moment the crowd was fairly stunned.
Then wild howls and yells arose and an uproar ensued
that was deafening. Staid citizens forgot
their dignity and danced up and down like madmen,
utter strangers hugged each other, straw hats
were tossed into the air or smashed on their owners’
heads. Then the crowd hurdled over the
stands and swooped down on the players who were
making tracks as fast as they could for the clubhouse
to escape the deluge.</p>

<p>“A no-hit game! A triple play!” gasped
McRae, as he almost wrenched Joe’s arm from its
socket. “Joe, you’re a wonder. And now for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
tour around the world. You’ve got to go with me,
Joe. I won’t take No for an answer. You’ll be
our greatest drawing card.”</p>

<p>How Joe accepted the invitation and the startling
events that followed will be told in the next
volume of the series, to be entitled: “Baseball Joe
Around the World; Or, Pitching on a Grand
Tour.”</p>

<p>It was a long time before Joe could tear himself
away from his hilarious team-mates and reach his
party at the Marlborough. How his mother cried
over him in her joy and pride, how Mr. Matson
wrung his hand and patted his shoulder hardly
trusting himself to speak, how Clara hugged and
kissed him, how Mabel would have liked to do the
same but did not dare to, how Jim and Reggie
mauled and pounded him&mdash;all this can be easily
guessed. They were happy beyond all words.</p>

<p>But there was an impalpable something in the
air that gradually thinned out the party. Mrs.
Matson motioned her husband to come with her.
Jim and Clara, only too glad of the excuse, slipped
away, casting a roguish glance behind them, and
even the obtuse Reggie remembered a letter he
had to write and vanished.</p>

<p>Joe and Mabel, left alone, looked at each other,
but Mabel’s eyes fell instantly before what they
read in Joe’s. Her cheeks flushed, her breath came
faster and she began to tremble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mabel,” Joe began, a trifle huskily.</p>

<p>“Yes, Joe,” she faltered.</p>

<p>He took her little glove from his pocket and
bent toward her tenderly.</p>

<p>“This little glove of yours has done wonders
for me,” he said. “It has helped me to win two
championships. But these victories are nothing to
me unless I win you, too. Will you be my wife,
Mabel&mdash;will you? You know I love you.”</p>

<p>He read his answer in the beautiful eyes full of
love and trust that she turned up to his. The
next instant she was in his arms.</p>

<p>Decidedly, it was Joe’s winning day.</p>

<p>And that good right arm of his had made it a
winning day also for hosts of others. The whole
National League was aflame with exultation. The
city of New York was wild with joy. And every
member of the Giant team was tasting the delights
of victory to the full.</p>

<p>They had all played their parts well and ably.
But they knew perfectly well that more credit belonged
to Joe than to any one else and they were
loud in their praises of his skill and courage.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen some dandy pitching in my life,” Robson
declared to the group of Giant players who
had gathered round for an impromptu jollification,
“but that performance of Matson’s this afternoon
was far and away the best of all. He was as
cool as a cucumber and it was impossible to rattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
him. He couldn’t have done better. He’s the
greatest pitcher in the League to-day, barring
none!”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” exclaimed McRae, clapping
him on the shoulder. “I tell you, Robbie, it was a
great day for New York when I signed Baseball
Joe for the Giant team!”</p>
